## Understanding the Error

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand what this error message means. This error message is thrown when we are trying to access a property that doesn't exist on the collection instance. The error message tells us that the property we are trying to access is not present on the collection instance.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Now that we have a better understanding of the error message, let's take a look at some of the troubleshooting steps we can take to solve this issue.

### Step 1: Check the Property Name

The first step is to check the property name. Make sure that the property name you are trying to access is spelled correctly and is in the correct case. Sometimes, a simple typo can cause this error message to occur. Double-checking the property name can save you a lot of time and frustration.

### Step 2: Check the Collection Instance

The next step is to check the collection instance. Make sure that the collection instance you are trying to access has the property you are looking for. Sometimes, a property can be removed or renamed from the collection instance, which can cause this error message to occur. Make sure that the property you are trying to access is defined on the collection instance.

### Step 3: Check the Model

The third step is to check the model. Make sure that the property you are trying to access is defined on the model. If the property is not defined on the model, then it will not be present on the collection instance, which can cause this error message to occur.

### Step 4: Check the Database

The fourth step is to check the database. Make sure that the property you are trying to access is present in the database. If the property is not present in the database, then it will not be present on the collection instance, which can cause this error message to occur.

### Step 5: Check the View

The fifth step is to check the view. Make sure that the property you are trying to access is present in the view. If the property is not present in the view, then it will not be present on the collection instance, which can cause this error message to occur.

### Step 6: Restart the Server

The final step is to restart the server. Sometimes, a simple restart can solve the issue. Restarting the server can clear any cached data and reload the application, which can solve the issue.
