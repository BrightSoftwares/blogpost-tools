The modern customer journey relies on many systems working together, and Iam is essential in making sure it can happen seamlessly and efficiently.

The last few years have demonstrated an irreversible trend towards digitalisation across every industry, and this will have massive consequences for the future. - said Luis Lancos keynote speaker at Computing's recent Deskflix Identity and Access Management.

# What are the 4 main areas of digital transformation?

**The four primary areas of digital transformation include:**

-   Customer Experience (CX)
-   Data & Analytics.
-   Cloud Computing.
-   Mobility.


# How does digitalization affect society?

Digital transformation affects not just one industry, but the whole economic and social fabric of society. He pointed to the emergence of super-apps like China's Wechat and Alipay as examples. With the rise of transformational future technologies such as blockchain and digital currencies, we may see similar apps becoming mainstream in other countries.


# How is this influencing identity and access management? Iam? 

Simply, because IAM is a key piece of the digital transformation pie on the customer journey - â€˜customer' in this case meaning any sort of end-user, from a member of the public to an employee.


# Why is UX important in digital transformation?

Customers today demand highly personalised seamless journeys. - fragmented customer journeys are no longer good. Enough said Lancos.


It might have taken several weeks in the past to enrol a new employee and finish putting up the applications they need. Today the expectation is minutes and if the process takes longer, red flags begin flying.


Customer expectation is understandable, but presents challenges, especially when you have to rely on partners and service providers that virtually every company does for some aspect of their it. As digital journeys become more seamless and integrations grow, complexity also rises.


A single user journey can involve several actors in the digital ecosystem - people, companies, apis, interfaces, environments - and making sure they all play together is a key role for Iam.


We live in a hyper-connected digital [[2023-01-24-abb-unit-unveils-new-era-of-automation-the-star|era]] where a single journey is no longer contained in one digital company.


This is possible only if everything is smooth across the whole spectrum, from security to [[2023-01-24-abb-unit-unveils-new-era-of-automation-the-star|automation]] to compliance.
