description: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
  applications. It allows users to define a set of related services, networks, and
  volumes in a single file, and then spin up the entire application with a single
  command. Docker Compose is a great way to quickly deploy applications and services,
  and it can be used to manage complex applications that require multiple services.   Docker
  is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications.
  It is a containerization technology that allows developers to package applications
  into isolated containers that can be run on any platform. Docker containers are
  lightweight and portable, and they can be used to quickly deploy applications in
  any environment.   A container is a lightweight, isolated environment that can be
  used to run applications. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their
  own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each
  other through well-defined channels. Containers
