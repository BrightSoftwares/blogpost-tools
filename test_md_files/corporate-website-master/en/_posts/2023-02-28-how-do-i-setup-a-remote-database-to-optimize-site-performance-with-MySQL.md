## Is MySQL a remote database?

MySQL is a type of [[2023-02-24-how-to-optimize-network-traffic-for-a-database|database]] management system, which can be installed and used on a local server or on a remote server. Whether MySQL is a remote database or not depends on how it is installed and used.

If MySQL is installed and used on a local server, it is not considered a remote database. However, if MySQL is installed and used on a remote server, it is considered a remote database.

In addition, MySQL can be used in a distributed database environment, where data is stored on multiple servers, including remote servers. In this case, MySQL can be used as a remote database as well.

Therefore, the answer to whether MySQL is a remote database or not is that it can be both, depending on how it is installed and used.

## 6 easy steps to setup a remote database

Here are the steps you can follow to set up a remote MySQL database:

### Step 1.  Choose a remote database service provider: 

There are many remote database service providers available, such as Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure SQL, etc. Choose a provider that best suits your needs.




#### 4.  Cost

I know what you are thinking: the lowest possible!

Compare pricing models and features between providers to find the one that best meets your budget and needs. Look for providers that offer flexible pricing models, such as pay-as-you-go or reserved instances, to help you manage costs.

 
#### 5.  Ease of use

Choose a provider that offers a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use tools for managing your database, such as automatic backups and monitoring.

#### 6.  Compatibility

Consider whether the provider's database solution is compatible with your existing applications and tools, such as programming languages, frameworks, and APIs.

#### 7.  Support

Choose a provider that offers reliable and responsive support, with multiple channels for communication and a robust knowledge base or documentation. Look for providers that offer 24/7 support to ensure that you can get help when you need it.
    
### Step 2.  Create a database instance

After choosing a provider, create a database instance in the provider's console. You will be asked to choose a database engine, select MySQL, and then configure the instance's settings, such as the size of the database and the credentials to access it.

I provide here the steps to create one:

1.  First, install MySQL server using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

2.  Once the installation is complete, start the MySQL server:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

3.  Next, log in to the MySQL server as the root user:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

4.  Create a new database instance with the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
```

5.  Create a new MySQL user and grant permissions to access the database instance:

```sql
CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

This will create a new MySQL database instance named `my_database`, and a new user with the username `my_user` and password `my_password` that has full privileges to access the database instance. Note that you can modify the database name, username, and password to match your specific needs.

    
### Step 3.  Configure the firewall: 

Once the database instance is created, configure the firewall to allow access to the database from your web server's IP address. This step is important to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to access the database.

To secure a MySQL server with a firewall on a Linux system, you can use the following steps:

1.  Determine the port number used by the MySQL server. By default, MySQL uses port `3306`.

2.  Set up the firewall to allow incoming traffic on the MySQL port. The exact commands to do this will depend on the firewall software you are using. For example, if you are using the UFW firewall on [[2020-04-04-how-to-install-wordpress-with-lemp-on-ubuntu-1604|Ubuntu]], you can use the following command to allow incoming traffic on port 3306:

```bash
sudo ufw allow mysql
```

3.  Block all other incoming traffic to the server using a default deny rule. This will prevent any unauthorized access to the server. For example, you can use the following command to block all incoming traffic except for traffic on ports 22 (SSH) and 3306 (MySQL):

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw allow mysql
```

4.  Enable the firewall to start automatically when the system boots up:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ufw
```

5.  Verify that the firewall is properly configured by checking its status:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

This should display a list of the currently enabled firewall rules, including the rule allowing incoming traffic on the MySQL port.

By following these steps, you can secure your MySQL server with a firewall, preventing unauthorized access to the database.

### Step 4.  Connect to the database: 

After configuring the firewall, connect to the database from your web server using the credentials you set up in step 2. You can use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench to manage the database.

### Step 5.  Update your website's configuration: 

Update your website's configuration to use the remote MySQL database instead of the local one. Depending on the platform you are using, this step may vary.
    
### Step 6.  Test the site: 

Finally, test the site to ensure that it is using the remote database correctly and that the site's performance has improved.

## Conclusion

Setting up a remote database can be a little daunting. I hope that with the steps above you can easily handle it. By following these steps, you can set up a remote MySQL database and optimize your site's performance.
