In this article, we will discuss how to create multiple where clause queries using [[2023-12-03-laravel-5-remove-public-from-url|Laravel]] Eloquent.

## Understanding Eloquent Queries

Before we dive into multiple where clause queries, let's first understand what Eloquent queries are. Eloquent queries are a way of interacting with databases using object-oriented syntax. In other words, instead of writing [[2023-08-29-how-to-get-the-query-builder-to-output-its-raw-sql-query-as-a-string|SQL]] statements directly, you can use Eloquent methods to perform database operations.

Some common Eloquent methods include `find`, `where`, `orderBy`, `groupBy`, and `join`. These methods make it easy to retrieve data from databases and perform various operations on that data.

## Multiple Where Clause Query Using Laravel

Multiple where clause queries are a powerful way to retrieve data from databases based on multiple conditions. With [[2023-10-27-how-to-create-custom-helper-functions-in-laravel|Laravel]] Eloquent, you can create multiple where clause queries easily using the `where` method.

To create a multiple where clause query using [[2023-11-13-apache-and-laravel-5-remove-public-from-url|Laravel]] Eloquent, you simply chain multiple `where` methods together, like so:



`$users = DB::table('users')             ->where('name', 'John')             ->where('age', '>', 30)             ->get();`

In this example, we are retrieving all users whose name is John and whose age is greater than 30. By chaining multiple `where` methods together, we can create complex queries that filter data based on multiple conditions.

## Step by Step Guide to Creating Multiple Where

Let's walk through the process of creating a multiple where clause query using Laravel Eloquent step by step:

1.  Start by defining the table you want to query using the `table` method:



`$table = DB::table('table_name');`

2.  Chain one or more `where` methods together to define the conditions you want to filter by:



`$table->where('column_name', 'operator', 'value');`

For example:



```$table->where('name', '=', 'John'); $table->where('age', '>', 30);```

3.  Finally, use the `get` method to retrieve the data:



`$results = $table->get();`

By following these steps, you can create a powerful multiple where clause query using Laravel Eloquent.
