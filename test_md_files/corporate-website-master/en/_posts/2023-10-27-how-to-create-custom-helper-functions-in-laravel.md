[[2023-07-31-laravel-eloquent-groupby-and-also-return-count-of-each-group|Laravel]] is one of the most popular PHP frameworks in the world. It provides a plethora of built-in functions and libraries that developers can use to build [[2023-11-26-laravel-eloquent-artisan-the-ultimate-guide-to-building-stunning-web-applications|web]] applications quickly and efficiently. However, there are times when you need to create your own helper functions to accomplish a specific task or to simplify your code. In this article, we will discuss how to create custom helper functions in [[2023-05-10-laravel-eloquent-has-with-wherehas-what-do-they-mean|Laravel]].

Have you ever found yourself repeating the same code over and over again? Do you want to simplify your code and make it more readable? If your answer is yes, then you should consider creating your own helper functions. A helper function is a function that performs a specific task and can be reused in [[2023-11-15-how-to-create-multiple-where-clause-query-using-laravel-eloquent|multiple]] parts of your code.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you should have a basic understanding of PHP and [[2022-05-26-7-easy-steps-to-deploy-a-laravel-application-in-a-docker-container|Laravel]]. You should also have a [[2023-12-03-laravel-5-remove-public-from-url|Laravel]] project set up on your local machine. If you haven't done so already, you can follow the official [[2023-11-13-apache-and-laravel-5-remove-public-from-url|Laravel]] documentation to get started.

## Step 1: Create a Helpers File

The first step in creating a custom helper function is to create a helpers file. This file will contain all your custom helper functions. You can create this file anywhere in your project, but it's recommended to create it in the `app` directory.



`// app/helpers.php  <?php  function customHelperFunction() {     // Your code here }`

In the example above, we created a function called `customHelperFunction`. This function can be called from anywhere in your code.

## Step 2: Load the Helpers File

The next step is to load the helpers file in your Laravel project. You can do this by adding the following code in your `composer.json` file:



`{     "autoload": {         "files": [             "app/helpers.php"         ]     } }`

After you have added the code above, run the following command in your terminal:



`composer dump-autoload`

This command will reload your Laravel project's autoloader and make your helper functions available throughout your codebase.

## Step 3: Use Your Custom Helper Function

Now that you have created your custom helper function and loaded it into your Laravel project, you can use it in your code. You can call your custom helper function just like any other PHP function.



`// app/Http/Controllers/ExampleController.php  <?php  namespace App\Http\Controllers;  use Illuminate\Http\Request;  class ExampleController extends Controller {     public function index()     {         $result = customHelperFunction();          // Your code here     } }`

In the example above, we used our custom helper function in the `index` method of the `ExampleController` class.

## Step 4: Test Your Custom Helper Function

It's important to test your custom helper function to ensure that it works as expected. You can create a unit test to test your custom helper function.



`// tests/Unit/HelpersTest.php  <?php  namespace Tests\Unit;  use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;  class HelpersTest extends TestCase {     public function test_custom_helper_function()     {         $result = customHelperFunction();          // Your assertions here     } }`

In the example above, we created a unit test to test our custom helper function.
