description: If you've worked with Kubernetes, you know that managing multiple YAML
  files can be a daunting task. Fortunately, Helm Charts provide a solution to this
  problem. In this post, we will discuss the main features of Helm Charts and how
  they can simplify Kubernetes deployment.   Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes
  that enables the packaging and distribution of collections of Kubernetes DML files.
  Think of it as apt, yum, or Homebrew for Kubernetes. These collections of files
  are called Helm Charts and are stored in public and private registries.   Let's
  say you want to deploy Elasticsearch on your Kubernetes cluster. You would need
  to create several components such as a StatefulSet for stateful applications like
  databases, a ConfigMap with external configuration, a Secret for storing credentials
  and secret data, a service account with permissions, and a couple of services.  Creating
  all of these files manually can be a tedious job. Fortunately, someone has

If you've worked with [[2020-08-12-installing-kubernetes-with-minikube|Kubernetes]], you know that [[2023-08-20-managing-multiple-clusters-with-argocd|managing multiple]] YAML [[2022-07-28-how-to-copy-files-from-host-to-docker-container|files]] can be a daunting task. Fortunately, [[2021-12-10-kubernetes-helm-how-to-show-multi-line-properties|Helm]] Charts provide a solution to this problem. In this post, we will discuss the main features of [[2023-12-18-understanding-helm-chart-structure-for-easier-deployment|Helm]] Charts and how they can simplify [[2023-04-04-should-a-docker-container-run-as-root-or-user|Kubernetes deployment]].

## What are Helm Charts?

[[2023-12-15-release-management-with-tiller-in-helm-version-2|Helm]] is a package manager for [[2022-03-25-how-to-solve-kubernetes-can-connect-with-localhost-but-not-ip|Kubernetes]] that enables the packaging and distribution of collections of [[2020-08-13-work-with-kubernetes-with-minikube|Kubernetes]] DML files. Think of it as apt, yum, or Homebrew for [[2020-08-12-play-with-kubernetes-with-minikube|Kubernetes]]. These collections of files are called [[2023-10-25-using-helm-practical-use-cases|Helm]] Charts and are stored in public and private registries.

## Simplifying Kubernetes Deployment

Let's say you want to deploy Elasticsearch on your [[2020-04-03-how-to-set-up-the-codeserver-cloud-ide-platform-on-digitalocean-kubernetes|Kubernetes]] [[2023-08-16-argo-cd-cluster-disaster-recovery|cluster]]. You would need to create several components such as a StatefulSet for stateful [[2023-12-04-can-you-run-gui-applications-in-a-linux-docker-container|applications]] like databases, a ConfigMap with external configuration, a Secret for storing credentials and secret data, a [[2022-01-11-how-to-fix-cannot-tcp-connect-from-outside-virtual-machine-network-traffic-not-forwarded-to-service-port|service]] account with permissions, and a couple of services.

[[2023-05-10-building-microservices-with-docker-creating-a-product-service|Creating]] all of these files manually can be a tedious job. Fortunately, someone has already done the work for you and packaged them up into a Helm Chart. With Helm, you can create your own Helm Charts or download and [[2021-12-14-how-to-use-local-docker-images-with-minikube|use]] existing ones from a Helm repository.

## Using Helm Charts

Helm Charts are available for commonly used deployments like [[2022-05-08-can-docker-connect-to-database|database]] applications (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB, [[2023-05-12-running-mysql-server-in-docker-container-and-connecting-to-it-from-host-machine|MySQL]]) and monitoring applications like Prometheus. Using the simple command `helm install <chart-name>`, you can reuse the configuration that someone else has already made without additional effort.

Apart from public repositories for Helm Charts like Helm Hub, there are also private registries for sharing charts within organizations. Several tools are available for using Helm Charts private repositories as well.

## Conclusion

Helm Charts provide a convenient way to package collections of [[2023-12-22-convert-docker-compose-to-kubernetes|Kubernetes]] DML files and distribute them in public and private registries. They simplify [[2021-12-26-how-to-expose-a-port-on-minikube|Kubernetes deployment]] by allowing users to reuse configurations that others have already created. If you're working with [[2023-10-23-argocd-as-a-kubernetes-extension-advantages-and-benefits|Kubernetes]], you should definitely give Helm Charts a try!
