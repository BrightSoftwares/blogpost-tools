description: Docker is a powerful tool for running applications in containers. It
  allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a single container,
  which can then be deployed on any platform. This makes it easy to deploy applications
  on different platforms without having to worry about compatibility issues. In this
  article, we will discuss how to run a stopped container in Docker.   A stopped container
  is a container that has been stopped by the user or by the system. When a container
  is stopped, it is no longer running and all of its processes are terminated. This
  means that any data stored in the container is no longer accessible.   There are
  several reasons why you might want to run a stopped container. For example, you
  might want to debug an application that is running in the container, or you might
  want to access data stored in the container.   Running a stopped container
