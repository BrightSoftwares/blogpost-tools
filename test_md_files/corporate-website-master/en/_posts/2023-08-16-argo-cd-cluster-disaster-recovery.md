## Argo CD for Cluster Disaster Recovery

Argo CD is a popular [[2023-07-30-benefits-of-using-gitops-with-argocd|GitOps]] tool that helps you automate your [[2020-08-12-play-with-kubernetes-with-minikube|Kubernetes]] deployments. It helps you manage your entire cluster configuration as code and keeps your cluster in sync with your Git repository. One of the [[2023-10-23-argocd-as-a-kubernetes-extension-advantages-and-benefits|benefits]] of using Argo CD is that it makes cluster disaster recovery super easy.

Let's say you have an Elastic [[2021-12-10-kubernetes-helm-how-to-show-multi-line-properties|Kubernetes]] [[2022-01-11-how-to-fix-cannot-tcp-connect-from-outside-virtual-machine-network-traffic-not-forwarded-to-service-port|Service]] (EKS) cluster in region 1a that completely crashes. With Argo CD, you can create a new cluster and point it to the same Git repository where the complete cluster configuration is defined. Argo CD will then recreate the same exact state as the previous cluster without any intervention from your side.

This is because your entire cluster configuration is defined in code in a declarative way. By managing your cluster configuration as code, you can quickly and easily recover from cluster disasters without having to manually recreate every component.

## Benefits of Argo CD for Cluster Disaster Recovery

Using Argo CD specifically for disaster recovery has several benefits. First, it simplifies the recovery process by automating the recreation of your cluster. This means you don't have to manually recreate every component, saving you time and effort.

Second, Argo CD allows you to quickly roll back to a previous working state if something goes wrong with your cluster. Since your entire cluster configuration is defined in code and stored in your Git repository, you can easily revert to a previous working [[2023-12-15-release-management-with-tiller-in-helm-version-2|version]] by moving back to the last working version in the Git history. This ensures that you can recover from disasters quickly and with minimal downtime.

Finally, Argo CD is highly scalable and efficient, especially if you have multiple clusters that are all updated by the same Git repository. You don't have to manually revert each and every component, doing `kubectl delete` or `[[2021-12-10-kubernetes-helm-how-to-show-multi-line-properties|helm]] uninstall`, and cleaning up all the things. Instead, you simply declare the previous working state, and the cluster will be synced to that state again.

In conclusion, cluster disaster recovery is a critical part of any [[2020-04-03-how-to-set-up-the-codeserver-cloud-ide-platform-on-digitalocean-kubernetes|cloud]]-native [[2023-12-18-understanding-helm-chart-structure-for-easier-deployment|deployment]]. Argo CD can simplify the disaster recovery process and ensure that your cluster is up and running as quickly as possible. By managing your entire cluster configuration as code and using Argo CD to automate the recovery process, you can quickly and easily recover from disasters and minimize downtime.
