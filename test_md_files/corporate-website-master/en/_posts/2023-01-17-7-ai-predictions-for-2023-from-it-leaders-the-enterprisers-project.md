title: 7 AI predictions for 2023 from IT leaders

December is here, so you know what that means: holiday parties, new year’s resolutions, and a slew of technology predictions. This was the hottest topic in Ai today for it leaders and we focus on Ai insight for your team and business.


The potential impacts of ai are wide-ranging as are the related forecasts for everything from intelligent intelligence in the sentient, to generative and responsible ai, to collaboration and automation. What will affect it? Leadership in 2023? We talked to industry career experts in the fields of artificial intelligence and Ic.


Io of Diego Bartolome predicts that machine learning will help correct ai bias. In conversational ai systems that can determine a customer by leveraging information about that person can reduce bias. Also,


And that's just a start. Let's look at other important trends.


#  CTOs will be particularly specific to AI.


A Cto needs to provide technology that improves healthcare services and processes. After all providers want physicians to focus on the delivery of healthcare and not technology. Ctos shouldn't buy Ai because it's ai. Ctos should instead think about ai opportunities. How do you do it in your organization? How will it improve business processes? And that's crucial. You could get away with saying we were implementing Ai or [[2023-02-07-asc-to-establish-digital-supply-chain-australian-defence-magazine|digital]] transformation and get a blank check, but that won't fly anymore. Organisations want to see results and need to be able to measure their impact. Ctos in the industry can't just say ai is the future and get whatever budget they want. The rubber meets the road in 2023.

# Groundbreaking effects of AI technology.


In the next few years, Ai will have huge impact on medical care. Look at 2021 Breakthrough Prize winner Dr. David Baker. Baker used artificial intelligence to design new proteins. This ground-breaking technology will continue to have huge implications in the life sciences, potentially developing life-saving treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.


Watch the crossover from fundamental physics to Informatics under the name of Quantum and Quantum-inspired computing. While I'm not holding my breath for a practical quantum computer, we'll see crossover. Perhaps one of the more intriguing examples is Andy Briggs Quantrolox, where artificial intelligence is being used to tune quantum computers.


A mix of advanced mathematics and information technology is likely to bring a new generation of engineers uniquely placed to exploit the wave of ai.

# At the intersection of human and artificial intelligence,


As artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly popular, it must be balanced by appropriate human intervention. Humans using the insights provided by Ai will be a more effective combination overall than doing the tasks alone. How and where this balance is struck will vary depending on the industry and the criticality of the function. According to new research, radiologists screened breast cancer more effectively using artificial intelligence than they did when working alone. In the hands of a radiological engineer, that same Ai also produces more accurate results than if it operated alone.


eg. Nadhan Global Chief Architect Leader Red Hat.


The use of Ai revolutionaries in different industries such as healthcare and auto and other fields is something you should read about.


# Intelligent Systems with a responsible and generative focus are advancing.


In 2023, we can expect to see some major ai trends and two to watch are responsible ai and generative ai. Responsible or ethical Ai has been a hot topic for some time, but should well move from concept to practice next year. The latest [[2023-02-07-asc-to-establish-digital-supply-chain-australian-defence-magazine|digital]] transformations and legal frameworks around Ai are also steps in the right direction. For example, the Ai Act is a proposed first-of-its-kind Eu law established to govern the risk of Ai use cases. The Ai Act could become a baseline standard for responsible Ai and aims to become law in next spring. This will have an impact on the companies using artificial intelligence worldwide.

The second generation of Ai is set to make major strides in the coming year. Recent models can easily create realistic pictures and drawings from a description in natural language. Capabilities like this move from cool functionality to actual business use cases. Dozens of companies offer products that will write essays, ad copy, or love letters. Instead of searching stock photography, you can search a search box and get a new image. And this is just the beginning of generative voice and video applications, and it will be interesting to see innovations and use cases emerge in the coming year.

# Stronger collaboration between the business and It teams.


In 2023, as companies prepare for greater economic volatility, there will be more pressure not only to do more with less, but also to demonstrate Ai's business value. From the onset. The underlying technology requires strong collaboration between the business and the It to ensure it is effectively addressing business needs and problems.


Another trend that was already seen is the continued push for ai holistically throughout the organization. Various software and hardware solutions from data models to ai chips are focused on a slice of the lucrative ai pie.

# AI will change the efficiency of organizations and its output.


A discussion on whether Ai will become sentient and pose a threat to humanity that vastly overestimates its current capabilities. Ai already accomplishes many tasks that would take humans thousands of hours to complete. Beat chess grandmasters, identify fractures in x-rays, choose the fastest route for a delivery truck, etc. But Ai doesn't understand how it performs these tasks. It cant explain why one move is more strategic than another the way a human could and knows. But Ai can accomplish a vast array of tasks both in and outside the workplace.


We need to understand why Ai can do so much, even though it lacks humanlike intelligence. Will Ai solve many of the legal problems people with time-sensitive jobs still have to do with lawyers billing in six-minute increments? I think the use of Ai for task automation will have a positive effect on team performance and output.

# Automation that is driven by AI and supported.


Everybody understands the value of automation, and in our software-defined world, almost everything can be automated. However, the decision point or the trigger for automation is still one of the more difficult elements. This is where Ai will increasingly come in. Ai can make less brittle decisions more intelligent than automations traditional 'if-this-then' rules.
