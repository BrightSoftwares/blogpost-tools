ASC says the benefits include better prediction and decision making, resulting in greater efficiencies and protection against disruptions. It also places data security front of mind as new supply chain solutions are designed and implemented. A pilot supplier portal was launched on 23 November, with a select group of 10 suppliers given access. The balance of suppliers will be added, along with additional portal functionality, in a scaled 2023 roll-out. The supplier portal is a multi-functional platform that will assist with contract creation and management, sourcing and invoice management, and supplier collaboration. ASC Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Stuart Whiley said establishing a digital supply chain would benefit both ASC’s outcomes and those of the Australian businesses it works with. “Fully digitising our supply chain is a strategic focus for ASC within our current Digital Transformation Program, as we complete the transition to a digital shipyard,” Whiley said. “An effective digital supply chain has many benefits including real time reporting, advanced parts and logistics tracking and real time monitoring of supplier performance. “It will ensure ASC remains at the forefront of supply chain best practice, delivering efficiencies that will benefit our critically important business of sustaining the Collins Class submarines and delivering the fleet’s life of type extension. “The supplier portal will benefit our supply chain partners through improved information flow and increased responsiveness, improving our relationships with these businesses. “The pilot will enable us to test the systems to ensure a seamless roll-out next year. “It’s an exciting time for our business and we look forward to working with our current partners and inviting new partners on the journey with us.”
