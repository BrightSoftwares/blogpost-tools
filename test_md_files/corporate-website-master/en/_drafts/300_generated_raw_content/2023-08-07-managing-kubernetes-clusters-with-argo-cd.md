title: Managing Kubernetes clusters with Argo CD

Managing Kubernetes clusters can be a complex and challenging task. As a DevOps engineer or a Kubernetes administrator, you have to manage multiple clusters, handle different access permissions, and ensure that the desired state of your cluster is always in sync with the actual state.

One tool that can help with this is Argo CD. In this article, we will discuss what Argo CD is, how it works, and its benefits. We will also look at how you can deploy and configure Argo CD in your Kubernetes environment.

## What is Argo CD?

Argo CD is an open-source continuous delivery tool that helps you manage and deploy applications in your Kubernetes environment. It provides a declarative and GitOps-based approach to managing your clusters. With Argo CD, you can use Git as the source of truth for your Kubernetes cluster, and you can manage cluster permissions indirectly through Git.

Argo CD is deployed directly in the Kubernetes cluster and extends the Kubernetes API with custom resource definitions (CRDs) to allow you to configure it using Kubernetes native YAML files. It is built to leverage existing Kubernetes functionalities to perform its job, such as using Kubernetes IDs for storing data and using Kubernetes controllers for monitoring and comparing the actual and desired state.

## How Does Argo CD Work?

Argo CD is an agent that runs in the Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for updating the actual state of the cluster with the desired state. It works by monitoring a Git repository that contains the desired state of the cluster. When changes are made to the Git repository, Argo CD automatically applies those changes to the cluster.

The Git repository acts as the source of truth for the Kubernetes cluster, and Argo CD ensures that the actual state of the cluster always matches the desired state. This means that you can manage your cluster permissions indirectly through Git without having to create cluster roles and users for each team member with different access permissions.

## Benefits of Using Argo CD

One of the main benefits of using Argo CD is that it provides easy cluster access management. Because of the pull model, you only need to give engineers access to the Git repository and not the cluster directly. In addition, it also provides easier cluster access management for non-human users like CI/CD tools such as Jenkins.

Another benefit of using Argo CD is the visibility it provides in the cluster. It gives you real-time updates of the application state and allows you to monitor deployment state after the application was deployed or after changes in the cluster configuration have been made. This means that you can see in real time if configuration files were applied, pods were created, and the application is running in a healthy or failing status.

## Deploying and Configuring Argo CD

To deploy Argo CD, you need to follow these steps:

1.  Install the Argo CD server and its dependencies in your Kubernetes cluster.
    
2.  Create an Argo CD application that defines which Git repository should be synced with which Kubernetes cluster.
    
3.  Configure Argo CD to work with multiple clusters if needed.
    

To configure Argo CD, you need to define an application CRD in a Kubernetes native YAML file. The main part of the configuration is defining which Git repository should be synced with which Kubernetes cluster. You can configure multiple applications for different microservices and group them in an app project CRD.

Working with multiple clusters in Argo CD can be achieved by either deploying multiple Argo CD instances, one for each cluster, or by deploying one Argo CD instance and configuring it to deploy changes to all cluster replicas at the same time.

## Conclusion

Argo CD is a powerful tool that can help you manage and deploy applications in your Kubernetes environment. It provides a declarative and GitOps-based approach to managing your clusters and ensures that the actual state of the cluster always matches the desired state. With Argo CD,
