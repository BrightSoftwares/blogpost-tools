# How to Pass Data to View in Laravel: A Guide for Beginners

Are you a beginner in Laravel and struggling with passing data to the view? Don't worry, you're not alone. Passing data from the controller to the view is an essential part of web development, and Laravel provides several ways to do it. In this article, we'll explore the different techniques to pass data to a view in Laravel.

## Understanding Views and Controllers in Laravel

Before diving into the different methods of passing data to views in Laravel, it's essential to understand the basics of views and controllers. Views in Laravel are responsible for displaying the HTML content to the user. Controllers, on the other hand, are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with models, and returning data to the views.

## Passing Data Using View Method

The view method in Laravel is the most common way of passing data to the view. With the view method, you can pass data to the view as an array or an object. Here's an example of how to pass data using the view method:



`$data = [    'name' => 'John Doe',    'email' => 'johndoe@example.com', ];  return view('profile', $data);`

In the above example, we pass an array of data to the view named `profile`. In the view, we can access the data using the keys of the array like this:



`<h1>{{ $name }}</h1> <p>{{ $email }}</p>`

## Passing Data Using Compact Method

Another way of passing data to the view is by using the compact method. With the compact method, you can pass data to the view as variables. Here's an example of how to pass data using the compact method:



`$name = 'John Doe'; $email = 'johndoe@example.com';  return view('profile', compact('name', 'email'));`

In the above example, we pass two variables named `$name` and `$email` to the view named `profile`. In the view, we can access the data using the variable names like this:



`<h1>{{ $name }}</h1> <p>{{ $email }}</p>`

## Passing Data Using With Method

The with method in Laravel is similar to the view method, but instead of passing data as an array or object, we pass it as a series of key-value pairs. Here's an example of how to pass data using the with method:



`return view('profile')->with('name', 'John Doe')->with('email', 'johndoe@example.com');`

In the above example, we pass two key-value pairs named `name` and `email` to the view named `profile`. In the view, we can access the data using the keys like this:



`<h1>{{ $name }}</h1> <p>{{ $email }}</p>`

## Passing Data Using the Data Method

The data method in Laravel allows us to pass data to multiple views. Here's an example of how to pass data using the data method:



`$data = [   'name' => 'John Doe',   'email' => 'johndoe@example.com',];  view()->share('data', $data);`

In the above example, we pass an array of data to multiple views using the data method. In the view, we can access the data using the keys like this:



`<h1>{{ $data['name'] }}</h1> <p>{{ $data['email'] }}</p>`
