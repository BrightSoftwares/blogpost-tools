Bulk Insertion in Laravel using eloquent ORM

# Bulk Insertion in Laravel using eloquent ORM

Are you tired of manually inserting records one by one into your Laravel application's database? Are you looking for a more efficient way to bulk insert records and speed up your database operations? Look no further than Laravel's eloquent ORM!

In this article, we'll cover the ins and outs of bulk insertion in Laravel using eloquent ORM, including the benefits of using this approach, how to set it up, and best practices for optimizing your bulk insertions.

## Benefits of Bulk Insertion in Laravel

Bulk insertion is a powerful tool for developers who need to insert a large number of records into their application's database quickly and efficiently. With eloquent ORM, you can easily insert hundreds or even thousands of records at once, significantly reducing the time and resources required for manual insertion.

Not only does bulk insertion save time, but it also helps to maintain the integrity of your database. When inserting records one by one, there's a greater chance of data errors or inconsistencies. However, with bulk insertion, you can ensure that all records are inserted correctly and that any errors are caught and addressed quickly.

## Setting up Bulk Insertion in Laravel

To get started with bulk insertion using eloquent ORM in Laravel, you'll need to follow a few simple steps:

### 1. Create a new eloquent model

First, create a new eloquent model for the table you'll be inserting records into. This model will allow you to interact with the table in your Laravel application, including inserting, updating, and retrieving records.

### 2. Use the create() method

Next, use the create() method to insert your records. The create() method takes an array of data as its argument, with each key-value pair representing a column and value for the record you want to insert.

### 3. Pass an array of data to the create() method

To insert multiple records at once, you can simply pass an array of data to the create() method, with each element of the array representing a new record to be inserted.

### 4. Use the insert() method for larger data sets

For larger data sets, you may want to use the insert() method instead of create(). The insert() method takes an array of arrays, with each inner array representing a new record to be inserted.

## Best Practices for Optimizing Bulk Insertion

To get the most out of your bulk insertion operations in Laravel using eloquent ORM, it's important to follow a few best practices:

### 1. Limit the number of records per batch

When inserting a large number of records, it's a good idea to limit the number of records per batch to avoid overwhelming your database. A batch size of 100-500 records is typically a good starting point.

### 2. Disable model events

By default, eloquent ORM triggers model events such as "saving" and "saved" when records are inserted. However, these events can slow down your bulk insertion operations significantly. To optimize performance, you can disable model events by adding the following code to your model:



`protected $dispatchesEvents = [];`

### 3. Use database transactions

Using database transactions can help to ensure that your bulk insertions are atomic and that any errors are rolled back. To use database transactions in Laravel, simply wrap your insertion code in a transaction block:



`DB::transaction(function () {     // Insert records here });`

## Conclusion

Bulk insertion using eloquent ORM in Laravel is a powerful tool for developers looking to insert large numbers of records into their application's database quickly and efficiently. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can optimize your bulk insertion operations and ensure that your database remains consistent and error-free.
