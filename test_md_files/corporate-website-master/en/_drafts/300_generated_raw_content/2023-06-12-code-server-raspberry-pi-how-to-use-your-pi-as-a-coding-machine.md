# Code Server Raspberry Pi: How to Use Your Pi as a Coding Machine

## Introduction

Have you ever wished you could code from anywhere, at any time, without having to carry around a bulky laptop? With the Raspberry Pi and Code Server, you can do just that! In this article, we’ll show you how to set up Code Server on your Raspberry Pi, so you can access your coding environment from any device with a web browser.

## What is Code Server?

Code Server is an open-source project that allows you to run a web-based version of Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, on any machine with a web browser. This means you can code from any device, including your Raspberry Pi, without having to install any software on the device itself.

## Setting up Code Server on Raspberry Pi

Here are the steps to set up Code Server on your Raspberry Pi:

### 1. Install VS Code

To use Code Server, you first need to install Visual Studio Code on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:



`curl -L https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-arm64 | sudo tar zx -C /usr/local/lib/ /usr/local/lib/code-*/bin/code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh`

### 2. Install Code Server

Next, you need to install Code Server on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by running the following commands:



`curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh`

### 3. Configure Code Server

Now that you have Code Server installed, you need to configure it to run as a service. Here are the steps:

1.  Create a new file called `code-server.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` by running the following command:



`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/code-server.service`

2.  Copy and paste the following code into the file:



```makefile
[Unit] 
Description=Code Server 
After=network.target  

[Service] 
User=pi 
Environment=
PASSWORD=password 
ExecStart=/usr/bin/code-server --bind-addr=0.0.0.0:8080 --auth=password 
Restart=always  

[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3.  Save the file and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter`.
    
4.  Start the Code Server service by running the following commands:
    



`sudo systemctl enable code-server sudo systemctl start code-server`

### 4. Accessing Code Server

Now that Code Server is running as a service, you can access it from any device with a web browser by typing in the IP address of your Raspberry Pi followed by `:8080` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`). You’ll be prompted to enter the password you set in the `code-server.service` file.

## Benefits of Using Code Server on Raspberry Pi

Using Code Server on your Raspberry Pi has several benefits, including:

### 1. Portability

With Code Server, you can code from anywhere, as long as you have a web browser and an internet connection. This makes it perfect for coding on the go, without having to carry around a bulky laptop.

### 2. Resource Efficiency

Code Server runs on your Raspberry Pi, which means you don’t need a powerful computer to code. This makes it a great option for people who don’t have access to high-end hardware.

### 3. Familiarity

If you’re already familiar with Visual Studio Code, then using Code Server will be a breeze. You’ll have access to all of the
