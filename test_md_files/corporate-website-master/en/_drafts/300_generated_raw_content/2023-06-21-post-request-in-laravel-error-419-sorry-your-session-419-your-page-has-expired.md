# Post Request in Laravel - Error - 419 Sorry, Your Session/419 Your Page has Expired

As a Laravel developer, you might have encountered a frustrating error message: "419 Sorry, your session/419 your page has expired" when submitting a post request. This error can make you feel angry, annoyed, and confused. In this article, we will dive into the details of this error message, why it occurs, and how to solve it. So, let's get started.

## What is a Post Request in Laravel?

Before we discuss the error message, let's understand what a post request is in Laravel. A post request is a method used to send data to the server. It is used when you want to create or update data on the server. For example, when a user submits a form, the data is sent to the server using a post request.

## Why Does the Error Occur?

Now, let's talk about why the "419 Sorry, your session/419 your page has expired" error occurs. This error occurs when the CSRF token is not included or is invalid in the post request. The CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It is generated when the user first visits the page and is stored in the session. When the user submits a form, the CSRF token is included in the post request. If the token is missing or invalid, Laravel assumes that the request is not legitimate and returns the "419" error.

## How to Solve the Error?

Now, let's move on to the solution. To solve the "419 Sorry, your session/419 your page has expired" error, you need to include the CSRF token in the post request. There are two ways to do this:

### 1. Include CSRF Token in the Form

The first way is to include the CSRF token in the form. Laravel provides a helper function called `csrf_field()` that generates a hidden input field with the CSRF token value. You can include this function in your form like this:



`<form method="POST" action="/example">     @csrf     <!-- Other form fields --> </form>`

### 2. Include CSRF Token in the Request Header

The second way is to include the CSRF token in the request header. To do this, you need to add the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header to the post request with the value of the CSRF token. You can do this using JavaScript like this:



`var csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content'); axios.defaults.headers.common['X-CSRF-TOKEN'] = csrfToken;`

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the "419 Sorry, your session/419 your page has expired" error in Laravel occurs when the CSRF token is missing or invalid in the post request. To solve this error, you need to include the CSRF token in the post request using one of the two methods mentioned above. Remember, the CSRF token is a security feature in Laravel that helps prevent CSRF attacks, so it is important to include it in your post requests.
