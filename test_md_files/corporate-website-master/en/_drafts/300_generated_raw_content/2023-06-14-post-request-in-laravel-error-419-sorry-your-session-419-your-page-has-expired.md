## How to Fix 419 Error in Laravel POST Requests?

### Introduction

When you encounter an error message that says "419 Sorry, your session has expired. Please refresh and try again" after submitting a POST request in Laravel, it means that the `csrf` token verification failed. In this article, we will explore some of the possible solutions to fix this issue.

### Ensure `@csrf` is Present in the Form

One of the common causes of the 419 error in Laravel is due to the absence of the `@csrf` blade directive in the form. You should ensure that you have included it in your form.



```html
<form method="post">
    @csrf
    <!-- rest of the form -->
</form>
```

### Check the Session Driver

The `csrf` token verification is directly involved with the session. Ensure that the session driver in the `.env` file is correctly configured. The supported session drivers in Laravel 5, 6, and 7 are:

-   `file` - sessions are stored in `storage/framework/sessions`.
-   `cookie` - sessions are stored in secure, encrypted cookies.
-   `database` - sessions are stored in a relational database.
-   `memcached / redis` - sessions are stored in one of these fast, cache-based stores.
-   `array` - sessions are stored in a PHP array and will not be persisted.

If the form works after switching the session driver, then the problem is with that particular driver.

### Possible Error-Prone Scenarios

-   In the case of the file-based sessions driver, permission issues with the `/storage` directory might cause issues.
-   For the database driver, ensure that the DB connection is correct and the `sessions` table exists and is correctly configured.
-   Wrong Redis/Memcached configuration or interference by other code in the system.
-   Execute `php artisan key:generate` to generate a new app key to flush the session data.
-   Clear the browser cache.

### Conclusion

The 419 error in Laravel can be frustrating, but it's often due to minor mistakes that can be fixed easily. Ensure that you have included `@csrf` in your form, and check that the session driver is correctly configured. Also, make sure that your app key is up to date, and clear the browser cache if necessary.
