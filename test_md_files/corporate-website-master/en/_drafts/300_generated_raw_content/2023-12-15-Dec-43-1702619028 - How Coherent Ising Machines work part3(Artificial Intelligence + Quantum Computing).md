# Quantum Computing Explained for Physicists

## I. Introduction

Quantum computing stands at the forefront of technological innovation, promising unprecedented computational power to tackle problems that classical computers find insurmountable. The utilization of **quantum mechanics** principles has led to the development of powerful machines capable of solving complex problems efficiently.

## II. Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) and Quantum Feedback

### A. Overview of the Coherent Ising Machine (CIM)

The Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) represents a quantum computational network integrated with feedback mechanisms. It provides a solution to NP-hard combinatorial problems, demonstrating capabilities in resolving intricate issues like the **traveling salesman problem** and its variations.

### B. Importance of Quantum Feedback in CIM

Quantum feedback plays a pivotal role in enhancing the computational prowess of CIMs. The quantum master equation, a fundamental concept in CIMs, elucidates the dynamics of these machines with and without feedback. 

### C. Discussion on Master Equations in Quantum Computing

The derivation of the quantum master equation for CIMs involves two distinct types: conditional and unconditional. These equations are accurately simulated in scalable ways using stochastic equations in the positive-P phase-space representation, considering typical parameter values from ongoing experiments.

### D. Applications of CIMs in NP Hard Problems

The CIM's ability to simulate coupled Ising spins presents a promising approach to solving hard optimization problems. Realizations of large-scale CIMs using hybrid optical-electronic setups have shown significant potential in computational tasks.

### E. Comparison of Conditional and Unconditional Master Equations

While both conditional and unconditional simulations align well, **unconditional simulation** exhibits greater efficiency and scalability, especially in larger setups. However, conditioning simulations on the feedback current significantly increases computational complexity.

## III. All-Optical Scalable Spatial CIM

### A. Understanding Optical Oscillators Simulating Ising Spins

Optical oscillators emulate the behavior of Ising spins within CIMs, offering ultrafast computation. However, electronic coupling represents a bottleneck affecting computational time, particularly concerning system size.

### B. Challenges with Electronic Coupling in CIMs

Electronic coupling limitations hinder CIMsâ€™ scalability. This bottleneck prompted the proposal of an all-optical scalable CIM with fully-programmable coupling, utilizing an optical parametric amplifier with a spatial light modulator (SLM).

### C. Proposal of All-Optical Scalable CIM with Fully-Programmable Coupling

The innovative setup integrates spin dynamics and coupling in parallel. Different coupling topologies can be achieved by configuring the SLM, enabling size-independent, ultrafast optical hardware for large-scale computations.

### D. Implementation Details and Benchmarking of the Proposed Machine

Numerical simulations validate the dynamics of the proposed all-optical CIM, showcasing its potential for high-speed computations. The incorporation of parallel spin dynamics and coupling lays the foundation for efficient quantum computation.

### E. Advantages of Parallel Spin Dynamics and Coupling

By executing both spin dynamics and coupling simultaneously, the proposed CIM overcomes traditional limitations, paving the way for unparalleled computational efficiency, irrespective of system size.

## IV. Conclusion

Quantum computing advancements, exemplified by CIMs, mark a transformative era in problem-solving capabilities. The proposed all-optical CIM with programmable coupling showcases the potential for size-independent, ultrafast computation, revolutionizing various industries.
