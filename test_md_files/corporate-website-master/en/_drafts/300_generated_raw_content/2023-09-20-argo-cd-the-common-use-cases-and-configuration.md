In the ever-evolving world of DevOps, keeping up with the latest tools and technologies is essential. One such tool that is gaining popularity in the DevOps community is Argo CD. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of Argo CD, including its use cases, architecture, and a hands-on demo to help you get started with this tool.

## What is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool that helps in managing the deployment of applications in Kubernetes. It uses a declarative approach to automate the deployment of applications to multiple clusters. Argo CD works by continuously monitoring a Git repository for changes in Kubernetes manifests and automatically applying those changes to the cluster. It provides a user interface to visualize and manage the application deployment, which helps in quickly identifying and resolving any issues that may arise.

## Common Use Cases

Argo CD is designed to automate the deployment of applications in Kubernetes and provide an efficient and effective way to manage application configuration. Some common use cases of Argo CD include:

-   **Deploying applications**: Argo CD can deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters in a simple and automated way.
    
-   **Rollback**: In case of a deployment failure, Argo CD can easily rollback the deployment to a previous version.
    
-   **Multi-environment deployment**: Argo CD can deploy the same application to multiple Kubernetes environments, such as development, staging, and production.
    
-   **Automated upgrades**: Argo CD can perform automated upgrades to Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that all applications are running on the latest version.
    

## How Argo CD Works

Argo CD follows a GitOps approach to deploy applications to Kubernetes. It continuously monitors the Git repository for changes in the Kubernetes manifests and automatically applies those changes to the cluster. Argo CD relies on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage applications, and it uses the Kubernetes API server to communicate with the cluster.

![Argo CD Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300.png?text=Argo+CD+Architecture)

As shown in the image above, Argo CD architecture consists of the following components:

-   **Application Controller**: This component is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application deployment. It continuously monitors the Git repository for changes and updates the Kubernetes manifests accordingly.
    
-   **API Server**: This component provides a REST API for Argo CD to interact with the Kubernetes API server.
    
-   **Repository Server**: This component provides a Git repository interface to Argo CD, enabling it to monitor the repository for changes.
    
-   **UI Server**: This component provides a web-based user interface to visualize and manage the application deployment.
    

## Hands-On Demo

To get some practical experience with Argo CD, we will set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes. We will deploy Argo CD and create a sample application to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. In the end, we will update the application and see how Argo CD automatically applies the changes to the cluster.

### Prerequisites

-   A Kubernetes cluster
-   kubectl installed
-   Helm installed

### Deploying Argo CD

To deploy Argo CD to your Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following commands:



`$ kubectl create namespace argocd $ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm $ helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --version 3.22.0`

### Creating a Sample Application

To create a sample application, you can use the following YAML manifest:



`apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata:   name: sample-app --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: sample-app   namespace: sample-app`

## Argo CD Workflow

Argo CD works by continuously monitoring the desired state of your application in GitOps repositories, and comparing it to the actual state of the application in the Kubernetes cluster. If there are any differences, Argo CD will automatically reconcile the state by deploying the necessary changes to the cluster.

![Argo CD Workflow Diagram Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Argo+CD+Workflow+Diagram)

The workflow of Argo CD can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Application Configuration in Git Repository:** You define the desired state of your application in a Git repository as a Kubernetes manifest file, such as a YAML file.
    
2.  **Argo CD Deployment:** You deploy Argo CD into your Kubernetes cluster. This will create a set of Kubernetes resources that provide the necessary components for Argo CD to work, including the Argo CD API server, the Argo CD application controller, and the Argo CD user interface.
    
3.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Argo CD continuously monitors the Git repository for any changes to the application configuration.
    
4.  **Comparison and Reconciliation:** When Argo CD detects changes to the application configuration, it compares the desired state with the actual state of the application in the Kubernetes cluster. If there are any differences, Argo CD will reconcile the state by deploying the necessary changes to the cluster.
    
5.  **Rollback and History:** Argo CD also keeps track of the history of changes made to your application configuration, which allows you to easily roll back to a previous version if necessary.
    

## Hands-On Demo

To get some practical experience with Argo CD, we will set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes using Argo CD. In this demo, we will use a sample application called "Guestbook" that consists of a Redis master and slave pair, along with a PHP guestbook frontend.

### Prerequisites

Before we get started with the demo, you will need to have the following:

-   A Kubernetes cluster
-   kubectl CLI tool installed
-   A Git repository for storing the application configuration

### Steps

1.  Deploy Argo CD into your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:



`$ kubectl create namespace argocd $ kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml`

2.  Access the Argo CD UI by port-forwarding the Argo CD server service:



`$ kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443`

3.  Log in to the Argo CD UI by visiting `https://localhost:8080` in your web browser and using the default username and password of `admin` and `password`.
    
4.  Create a new application in Argo CD by clicking on the "New App" button and filling out the application details. For this demo, we will use the Guestbook application from the Kubernetes examples repository:
    
    -   **Application Name:** guestbook
    -   **Project:** default
    -   **Repository URL:** [https://github.com/kubernetes/examples.git](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples.git)
    -   **Path:** guestbook/all-in-one
    -   **Cluster URL:** [https://kubernetes.default.svc](https://kubernetes.default.svc/)
5.  Configure automatic synchronization by enabling the "Auto-Sync" and "Self-Heal" options for the application.
    
6.  Trigger a deployment by making a change to the application configuration in the Git repository, such as modifying the `guestbook-service.yaml` file.
    
7.  Verify that the changes have been deployed to the Kubernetes cluster by checking the Kubernetes resources in the Argo CD UI or by using the `kubectl` CLI tool.

## Installing Argo CD

Now that we understand the basic concepts and components of Argo CD, let's move on to installing it. Argo CD provides different installation methods including Helm, Kustomize, Jsonnet, and more. For this demo, we will be using Helm to install Argo CD.

First, let's add the Argo CD Helm chart repository:



`$ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm`

Next, let's update our local Helm chart repository cache:



`$ helm repo update`

We can now install Argo CD using the following command:



`$ helm install argo argo/argo-cd \     --set server.extraArgs={--insecure} \     --version 2.18.2`

In this command, we are specifying that we want to install Argo CD using the `argo/argo-cd` Helm chart, and we are setting the server's `--insecure` flag so that we can access the Argo CD web UI using an HTTP connection instead of HTTPS (this is not recommended for production use). We are also specifying that we want to install version 2.18.2 of Argo CD.

After running this command, Argo CD should now be installed in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Setting Up a CD Pipeline with Argo CD

Now that we have Argo CD installed, let's set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes. In this demo, we will be using a simple Kubernetes Deployment and Service to demonstrate how Argo CD can automatically deploy changes to a Kubernetes cluster.

First, let's create a new Git repository to store our Kubernetes configuration files:



`$ mkdir argocd-demo $ cd argocd-demo $ git init $ touch README.md $ git add README.md $ git commit -m "Initial commit"`

Next, let's create a new Kubernetes Deployment file and a new Kubernetes Service file:



`# deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: nginx-deployment spec:   selector:     matchLabels:       app: nginx   replicas: 2   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: nginx     spec:       containers:         - name: nginx           image: nginx:latest           ports:             - containerPort: 80  # service.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-service spec:   selector:     app: nginx   ports:     - name: http       port: 80`

We can now commit these files to our Git repository:



`$ git add deployment.yaml service.yaml $ git commit -m "Add Kubernetes configuration files"`

Next, we need to create a new Argo CD Application to monitor our Git repository for changes and automatically deploy those changes to our Kubernetes cluster.

In the Argo CD web UI, click on the `+ NEW APP` button in the top-right corner. On the `CREATE NEW APP` screen, fill in the following information:

-   **Name**: `nginx`
-   **Project**: `default`
-   **Sync Policy**: `Automatic`
-   **Repository URL**: the URL of your Git repository (e.g. `https://github.com/my-username/argocd-demo.git`)
-   **Revision**: `HEAD`
-   **Path**: the path to your Kubernetes configuration files (e.g. `/`)
-   **Cluster**: the name of your Kubernetes cluster (e.g. `minikube`)

Click on the `CREATE` button to create the new Argo

## How does Argo CD work?

Argo CD uses a declarative configuration approach to deploy and manage applications. It allows users to define the desired state of their applications in a declarative YAML manifest file, which is then compared with the actual state of the applications running in the cluster. If there are any differences between the two states, Argo CD will automatically apply the necessary changes to bring the applications back to the desired state.

Argo CD also integrates with a wide range of Kubernetes resources and tools, including Helm charts, Kustomize, and Ksonnet. It can monitor changes made to these resources and automatically update the applications running in the cluster accordingly.

Another powerful feature of Argo CD is its ability to perform automated rollbacks. In case of any issues or errors during the deployment process, Argo CD can automatically roll back to the previous state of the application, ensuring that users have a reliable and stable environment.

## Argo CD Demo Project

To get some hands-on experience with Argo CD, let's walk through a simple demo project.

### Pre-requisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

-   Kubernetes cluster (minikube or any other Kubernetes cluster)
-   `kubectl` command-line tool
-   `helm` command-line tool
-   `argocd` command-line tool

### Installation

To install Argo CD on your cluster, run the following command:



`helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --create-namespace`

This will create a new namespace called `argocd` and install Argo CD in it.

### Accessing Argo CD Dashboard

Once the installation is complete, you can access the Argo CD dashboard by port-forwarding the service to your local machine:



`kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443`

Now, open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8080`. You should see the Argo CD login page.

### Setting up an Application

To set up a new application in Argo CD, we need to create a YAML manifest file that describes the desired state of the application. Here's an example manifest file for a simple Nginx deployment:



`apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata:   name: nginx   namespace: argocd spec:   destination:     namespace: default     server: https://kubernetes.default.svc   source:     repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git     targetRevision: HEAD     path: nginx   project: default   syncPolicy:     automated:       prune: true       selfHeal: true`

This manifest file specifies that we want to deploy an Nginx application in the `default` namespace. The source code for the application is located in a Git repository, and we want to use the latest version (`HEAD`) of the `nginx` folder. The `syncPolicy` section specifies that we want to automatically prune any resources that are no longer needed and self-heal the application in case of any issues.

To create the application in Argo CD, run the following command:



`argocd app create nginx --file nginx.yaml`

This will create a new application called `nginx` in Argo CD and deploy the Nginx application to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Continuous Deployment Pipeline

Now that we have our application set up in Argo CD, we can create a continuous deployment pipeline

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e)![User](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxZW1bm17GGxeKnZvNIeq9WloDUSy05B9sX8lC4X6Q%3Ds96-c&w=96&q=75)

## How does Argo CD work?

Argo CD operates based on the principle of declarative continuous delivery. It continuously monitors the desired state of the target environment and compares it with the actual state. If there are any differences between the two, Argo CD will try to reconcile them by updating the target environment to match the desired state.

Argo CD uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and manage applications. The application manifests are stored in a Git repository, and Argo CD uses GitOps to manage the deployment process.

The workflow with Argo CD can be summarized as follows:

1.  Define your application manifest in a Git repository.
2.  Install and configure Argo CD.
3.  Connect Argo CD to the Git repository.
4.  Create an application definition in Argo CD.
5.  Deploy the application.

Argo CD automates the deployment process by watching the Git repository for changes. When a change is detected, Argo CD will automatically update the Kubernetes resources to match the new desired state.

## Hands-on demo project

Now, let's do a hands-on demo project to deploy Argo CD and set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes.

For this demo project, we will need a Kubernetes cluster, kubectl, and Git.

### Step 1: Install Argo CD

To install Argo CD, we will use Helm. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications.



`$ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm $ helm install argo-cd argo/argo-cd`

This will install Argo CD in your Kubernetes cluster. You can check the installation status using the following command:



`$ kubectl get pods -n argocd`

### Step 2: Connect Argo CD to Git

To connect Argo CD to Git, we will need to create a secret that contains the Git credentials.



`$ kubectl create secret generic argocd-git-secret \     --from-literal=username=<username> \     --from-literal=password=<password> \     -n argocd`

Next, we need to configure Argo CD to use the Git secret.



`$ kubectl patch cm argocd-cm -n argocd --type merge \     -p '{"data": {"repository.credentialsSecret": "argocd-git-secret"}}'`

### Step 3: Create an application definition

To create an application definition in Argo CD, we will need to create an application manifest in our Git repository.

Create a new file named `myapp.yaml` in your Git repository with the following content:



`apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata:   name: myapp spec:   source:     repoURL: <your-git-repository-url>     path: myapp     targetRevision: HEAD     helm:       valueFiles:         - values.yaml   destination:     server: https://kubernetes.default.svc     namespace: default   syncPolicy:     automated:       prune: true       selfHeal: true`

This application manifest tells Argo CD to deploy the application from the `myapp` directory in our Git repository. It also specifies the Kubernetes cluster and namespace to deploy to, as well as the sync policy.

### Step 4: Deploy the application

To deploy the application, we need to create the application in Argo CD.



`$ argocd app create myapp \     --repo <your-git-repository-url> \     --path myapp \     --dest-server https://kubernetes.default`

Installing Argo CD
Now that we understand the basic concepts and components of Argo CD, let's move on to installing it. Argo CD provides different installation methods including Helm, Kustomize, Jsonnet, and more. For this demo, we will be using Helm to install Argo CD.

First, let's add the Argo CD Helm chart repository:

bash
Copy code
$ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
Next, let's update our local Helm chart repository cache:

bash
Copy code
$ helm repo update
We can now install Argo CD using the following command:

bash
Copy code
$ helm install argo argo/argo-cd \
    --set server.extraArgs={--insecure} \
    --version 2.18.2
In this command, we are specifying that we want to install Argo CD using the argo/argo-cd Helm chart, and we are setting the server's --insecure flag so that we can access the Argo CD web UI using an HTTP connection instead of HTTPS (this is not recommended for production use). We are also specifying that we want to install version 2.18.2 of Argo CD.

After running this command, Argo CD should now be installed in your Kubernetes cluster.

Setting Up a CD Pipeline with Argo CD
Now that we have Argo CD installed, let's set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes. In this demo, we will be using a simple Kubernetes Deployment and Service to demonstrate how Argo CD can automatically deploy changes to a Kubernetes cluster.

First, let's create a new Git repository to store our Kubernetes configuration files:

bash
Copy code
$ mkdir argocd-demo
$ cd argocd-demo
$ git init
$ touch README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
Next, let's create a new Kubernetes Deployment file and a new Kubernetes Service file:

yaml
Copy code
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:

kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
We can now commit these files to our Git repository:

bash
Copy code
$ git add deployment.yaml service.yaml
$ git commit -m "Add Kubernetes configuration files"
Next, we need to create a new Argo CD Application to monitor our Git repository for changes and automatically deploy those changes to our Kubernetes cluster.

In the Argo CD web UI, click on the + NEW APP button in the top-right corner. On the CREATE NEW APP screen, fill in the following information:

Another powerful feature of Argo CD is its ability to perform automated rollbacks. In case of any issues or errors during the deployment process, Argo CD can automatically roll back to the previous state of the application, ensuring that users have a reliable and stable environment.

Argo CD Demo Project
To get some hands-on experience with Argo CD, let's walk through a simple demo project.

Pre-requisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

Kubernetes cluster (minikube or any other Kubernetes cluster)
kubectl command-line tool
helm command-line tool
argocd command-line tool
Installation
To install Argo CD on your cluster, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --create-namespace
This will create a new namespace called argocd and install Argo CD in it.

Accessing Argo CD Dashboard
Once the installation is complete, you can access the Argo CD dashboard by port-forwarding the service to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
Now, open your web browser and navigate to https://localhost:8080. You should see the Argo CD login page.

Setting up an Application
To set up a new application in Argo CD, we need to create a YAML manifest file that describes the desired state of the application. Here's an example manifest file for a simple Nginx deployment:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: nginx
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
This manifest file specifies that we want to deploy an Nginx application in the default namespace. The source code for the application is located in a Git repository, and we want to use the latest version (HEAD) of the nginx folder. The syncPolicy section specifies that we want to automatically prune any resources that are no longer needed and self-heal the application in case of any issues.

To create the application in Argo CD, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
argocd app create nginx --file nginx.yaml
This will create a new application called nginx in Argo CD and deploy the Nginx application to the Kubernetes cluster.

Continuous Deployment Pipeline
Now that we have our application set up in Argo CD, we can create a continuous deployment pipeline

How does Argo CD work?
Argo CD operates based on the principle of declarative continuous delivery. It continuously monitors the desired state of the target environment and compares it with the actual state. If there are any differences between the two, Argo CD will try to reconcile them by updating the target environment to match the desired state.

Argo CD uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and manage applications. The application manifests are stored in a Git repository, and Argo CD uses GitOps to manage the deployment process.

The workflow with Argo CD can be summarized as follows:

Define your application manifest in a Git repository.
Install and configure Argo CD.
Connect Argo CD to the Git repository.
Create an application definition in Argo CD.
Deploy the application.
Argo CD automates the deployment process by watching the Git repository for changes. When a change is detected, Argo CD will automatically update the Kubernetes resources to match the new desired state.

Hands-on demo project
Now, let's do a hands-on demo project to deploy Argo CD and set up a fully automated CD pipeline for Kubernetes configuration changes.

For this demo project, we will need a Kubernetes cluster, kubectl, and Git.

Step 1: Install Argo CD
To install Argo CD, we will use Helm. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications.

shell
Copy code
$ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
$ helm install argo-cd argo/argo-cd
This will install Argo CD in your Kubernetes cluster. You can check the installation status using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
$ kubectl get pods -n argocd
Step 2: Connect Argo CD to Git
To connect Argo CD to Git, we will need to create a secret that contains the Git credentials.

lua
Copy code
$ kubectl create secret generic argocd-git-secret \
    --from-literal=username=<username> \
    --from-literal=password=<password> \
    -n argocd
Next, we need to configure Argo CD to use the Git secret.

css
Copy code
$ kubectl patch cm argocd-cm -n argocd --type merge \
    -p '{"data": {"repository.credentialsSecret": "argocd-git-secret"}}'
Step 3: Create an application definition
To create an application definition in Argo CD, we will need to create an application manifest in our Git repository.

Create a new file named myapp.yaml in your Git repository with the following content:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: <your-git-repository-url>
    path: myapp
    targetRevision: HEAD
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values.yaml
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
This application manifest tells Argo CD to deploy the application from the myapp directory in our Git repository. It also specifies the Kubernetes cluster and namespace to deploy to, as well as the sync policy.

Step 4: Deploy the application
To deploy the application, we need to create the application in Argo CD.

lua
Copy code
$ argocd app create myapp \
    --repo <your-git-repository-url> \
    --path myapp \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default
