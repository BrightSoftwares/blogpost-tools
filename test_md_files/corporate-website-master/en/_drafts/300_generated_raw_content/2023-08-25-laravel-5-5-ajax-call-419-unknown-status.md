Laravel 5.5 ajax call 419 (unknown status)

# Laravel 5.5 Ajax Call 419 (Unknown Status)

Have you ever encountered a Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error? If you have, then you know how frustrating it can be. This error can occur when sending an Ajax request to the server and it's a common issue that developers face when working with Laravel. But don't worry, in this article, we'll discuss the causes of this error and how to fix it.

## What is Laravel 5.5 Ajax Call 419 (Unknown Status) Error?

When you make an Ajax call in Laravel 5.5, it sends a CSRF token along with the request to verify that the request came from a trusted source. If the CSRF token is missing or incorrect, then Laravel will return a 419 error with an unknown status. This error occurs because Laravel cannot verify the authenticity of the request.

### Possible Causes of Laravel 5.5 Ajax Call 419 (Unknown Status) Error

There are several reasons why you might encounter a Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error. Here are some of the possible causes:

#### 1. Missing CSRF Token

As mentioned earlier, Laravel sends a CSRF token along with the Ajax request. If the token is missing, Laravel will return a 419 error.

#### 2. Incorrect CSRF Token

If the CSRF token sent with the Ajax request is incorrect, Laravel will also return a 419 error.

#### 3. Expired CSRF Token

CSRF tokens have a limited lifespan. If the token sent with the Ajax request has expired, Laravel will return a 419 error.

#### 4. Session Timeout

If the user's session has timed out, Laravel will not be able to retrieve the CSRF token, resulting in a 419 error.

#### 5. Cross-Domain Requests

If the Ajax request is sent to a different domain than the one the Laravel application is hosted on, the CSRF token will not be sent with the request, resulting in a 419 error.

### How to Fix Laravel 5.5 Ajax Call 419 (Unknown Status) Error

Now that we've identified the possible causes of the Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error, let's discuss how to fix it.

#### 1. Include CSRF Token in Ajax Request

The easiest way to fix the Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error is to include the CSRF token in the Ajax request. You can do this by adding the following code to your JavaScript file:



`$.ajaxSetup({     headers: {         'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')     } });`

This code adds the CSRF token to every Ajax request made on the page.

#### 2. Verify CSRF Token in Laravel

Another way to fix the Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error is to verify the CSRF token in Laravel. You can do this by adding the following code to your web.php file:



`Route::post('/your-route', function () {     // Verify CSRF token     if (!Session::token() == Request::header('X-CSRF-Token')) {         abort(419);     }      // Rest of your code });`

This code verifies the CSRF token in Laravel and returns a 419 error if the token is missing or incorrect.

#### 3. Increase CSRF Token Lifespan

If you're still encountering the Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error, you can increase the lifespan of the CSRF token. You can do this by adding the following code to your VerifyCsrfToken.php file:



`protected $addHttp`

#### 4. Increase Session Timeout

Another possible solution to fix the Laravel 5.5 Ajax call 419 (unknown status) error is to increase the session timeout. You can do this by changing the session lifetime in your config/session.php file.



`'lifetime' => 120, // in minutes`

#### 5. Allow Cross-Domain Requests

If you're sending an Ajax request to a different domain, you need to allow cross-domain requests. You can do this by adding the following code to your Laravel application's .htaccess file:



`<IfModule mod_headers.c>     Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" </IfModule>`

This code allows cross-domain requests by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to *.
