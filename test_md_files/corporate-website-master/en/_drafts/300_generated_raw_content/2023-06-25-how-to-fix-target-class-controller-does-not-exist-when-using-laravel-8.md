title: How to fix 'Target class controller does not exist' when using Laravel 8
---

## Problem

A Laravel 8 application throws a "Target class does not exist" error when attempting to access a route that refers to a controller.

For instance, when hitting a register route using Postman, the error message says "Target class [Api\RegisterController] does not exist."

## Possible cause

The error occurs because, in a fresh install of Laravel 8, there is no namespace prefix being applied to route groups. Hence, when referring to a controller in a route, it's necessary to use the Fully Qualified Class Name for the controller.

The absence of the namespace prefix is a change in Laravel 8. In previous versions of Laravel, the RouteServiceProvider contained a `$namespace` property, which Laravel used to automatically prefix controller route definitions and calls to the action helper/URL::action method. However, this property is null by default in Laravel 8, meaning Laravel won't automatically prefix namespaces.

## Solution

There are different ways to fix the error:

### Using Fully Qualified Class Name

Use Fully Qualified Class Name when referring to a controller in a route.


```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Api\RegisterController;

Route::get('register', [RegisterController::class, 'register']);
// or
Route::get('register', 'App\Http\Controllers\Api\RegisterController@register');
```

### Setting a Namespace on Route Groups

Set a namespace on route groups where controllers are defined.



```php
Route::middleware('api')
    ->namespace('App\Http\Controllers')
    ->group(function () {
        Route::get('register', 'Api\RegisterController@register');
    });
```

The `namespace()` method defines a namespace for the route group, and Laravel automatically adds this namespace to the controllers defined within the group.

### Using the `$namespace` Property

Uncomment the `$namespace` property in the `RouteServiceProvider` class and set it to the desired namespace.



```php
protected $namespace = 'App\Http\Controllers';
```

This method is the same as the previous one, but instead of using the `namespace()` method to set the namespace on the route group, it sets the namespace globally for all route groups.

## Execution Result

Running the commands below in the terminal show how each solution fixes the error.

### Using Fully Qualified Class Name

Running the following command in the terminal shows that using Fully Qualified Class Name fixes the error:


`php artisan route:list | grep register`

Output:


```| GET|HEAD | api/register    | App\Http\Controllers\Api\RegisterController@register```

### Setting a Namespace on Route Groups

Running the following command in the terminal shows that setting a namespace on the route group fixes the error:



```bash
php artisan route:list | grep register
```

Output:


```bash
| GET|HEAD | api/register    | App\Http\Controllers\Api\RegisterController@register
```

### Using the `$namespace` Property

Running the following command in the terminal shows that using the `$namespace` property fixes the error:


```bash
php artisan route:list | grep register
```

Output:



```bash
| GET|HEAD | api/register    | App\Http\Controllers\Api\RegisterController@register
```

## Conclusion

The "Target class [Controller] does not exist" error in Laravel 8 is due to the absence of a namespace prefix being applied to route groups by default. To fix the error, use Fully Qualified Class Name, set a namespace on the route group, or use the `$namespace` property.
