Laravel Eloquent Query: Using WHERE with OR AND OR?

# Laravel Eloquent Query: Using WHERE with OR AND OR?

Are you tired of writing complex SQL queries in your Laravel application? Do you want to simplify your database queries and improve your application's performance? If yes, then you must be familiar with Laravel Eloquent Query.

In this article, we will discuss how to use WHERE with OR AND OR in Laravel Eloquent Query, and how it can make your life easier.

## Understanding Laravel Eloquent Query

Laravel Eloquent Query is a simple and elegant way to interact with your database. It provides an easy-to-use, fluent interface for creating and executing database queries. With Laravel Eloquent Query, you don't have to write complex SQL queries anymore.

Laravel Eloquent Query provides various methods to perform database operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. It also provides a way to chain methods, which makes it easy to create complex queries.

## Using WHERE with OR AND OR

In Laravel Eloquent Query, you can use WHERE with OR AND OR to filter records from the database. This allows you to fetch records that match one or more conditions.

Let's say you have a table named 'users' with columns 'name', 'email', and 'phone'. You want to fetch all the records where the name is 'John' or the email is '[john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)' and the phone number is '123456789'.

You can use the following code to achieve this:



`$users = DB::table('users')             ->where('name', '=', 'John')             ->orWhere(function($query) {                 $query->where('email', '=', 'john@example.com')                       ->where('phone', '=', '123456789');             })             ->get();`

In the above code, we have used the where method to specify the condition for the 'name' column. Then we have used the orWhere method to specify the condition for the 'email' and 'phone' columns.

You can also use nested where clauses to create complex conditions.



`$users = DB::table('users')             ->where(function($query) {                 $query->where('name', '=', 'John')                       ->orWhere('name', '=', 'Jane');             })             ->where(function($query) {                 $query->where('email', '=', 'john@example.com')                       ->orWhere('email', '=', 'jane@example.com');             })             ->get();`

In the above code, we have used nested where clauses to fetch records where the name is 'John' or 'Jane' and the email is '[john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)' or '[jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com)'.
