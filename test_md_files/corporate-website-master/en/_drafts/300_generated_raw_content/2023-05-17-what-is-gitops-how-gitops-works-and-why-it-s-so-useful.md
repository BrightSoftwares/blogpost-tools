description: In this blog post, we're going to talk about what is Githubs and why
  it became so popular. The short explanation of Git Ups is infrastructure is code
  done right with all the best practices. Now let's see a bit longer explanation.
  So it all starts with Infrastructure as Code. As you know, the infrastructure's
  code concept is when you define your infrastructure as code instead of manually
  creating it. This makes our infrastructure much easier to reproduce and replicate.
  But note that infrastructure's code actually evolved into defining not only infrastructure,
  but also network as code or policy as code and configuration is called, etc. So
  it's not only about infrastructure anymore. these are all types of definitions as
  code or as they also call it, Xs code. So in X as code, Unified Infrastructure and
  Configuration Network, and so on in code. So for example, instead of manually creating
  servers and network and all the configuration around it

GitOps is a software development methodology that has gained popularity in recent years. It is a way of managing infrastructure as code by using version control systems like Git. In this article, we will explore what GitOps is and why it has become so popular. What it is and Why it Became Popular?

## Definition of GitOps

GitOps is a software development methodology that uses Git as a single source of truth for infrastructure as code. It involves managing the entire infrastructure through Git, including configuration files, deployment manifests, and other infrastructure components.

## Benefits of using GitOps

Using GitOps has several benefits, including:

-   **Traceability**: GitOps provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to the infrastructure, making it easy to track changes and understand who made them.
-   **Collaboration**: By using Git as a central repository, multiple team members can work together on the infrastructure codebase, making collaboration easier.
-   **Version control**: Git provides a version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes, revert to previous versions, and track changes over time.
-   **Consistency**: By using a single source of truth for infrastructure as code, it ensures that all environments are consistent and follow the same configuration.

## Infrastructure as Code

Before we dive into GitOps, it's important to understand the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC is the practice of managing infrastructure through code. It involves creating scripts or configuration files that define infrastructure components such as servers, networks, and storage.

### Overview of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC is an approach to managing infrastructure that treats it as code. It involves defining infrastructure components as code, typically using a domain-specific language (DSL). IaC provides several benefits, including:

-   **Repeatability**: Infrastructure can be easily replicated by using the same configuration scripts.
-   **Scalability**: As infrastructure needs change, IaC allows you to easily scale up or down.
-   **Efficiency**: Automating infrastructure management reduces the risk of human error and increases efficiency.

### Evolution of IaC to X as Code

IaC has evolved into "X as code," where X refers to various components of infrastructure. This includes:

-   **Configuration as code**: Defining application configuration as code.
-   **Security as code**: Managing security policies and controls as code.
-   **Compliance as code**: Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements through code.

### Types of definitions as code

There are several types of definitions as code, including:

-   **Declarative**: This type of definition specifies what the infrastructure should look like, without specifying how to achieve it.
-   **Imperative**: This type of definition specifies the steps required to create the infrastructure.

## Writing and Using Infrastructure as Code

Engineering teams typically write and use IaC in their day-to-day operations. This involves creating configuration files or scripts that define infrastructure components, such as servers, networks, and storage.

### Issues with current process

However, the current process of managing infrastructure as code can be challenging. For example, managing changes to the infrastructure can be difficult, with multiple team members making changes simultaneously. Additionally, applying changes to actual infrastructure can be a slow and manual process.

## Introduction to GitOps

GitOps provides a way to manage infrastructure as code in a more efficient and streamlined manner. It involves treating infrastructure as code like application code, and using Git as the central repository for all changes.

### Using GitOps for infrastructure as code

By using GitOps, infrastructure as code is hosted on a Git repository, which provides version control and team collaboration. Infrastructure changes are made through pull requests, which are validated and tested through a CI pipeline. Changes are then approved and merged


## Using GitOps for Infrastructure as Code

In the traditional approach to infrastructure management, changes are made to the configuration of production systems directly. With GitOps, the infrastructure is managed in a Git repository, just like code. This allows for better version control, collaboration, and traceability. By using GitOps for infrastructure as code, teams can take advantage of all the benefits that come with treating infrastructure as code.

### Hosted on Git Repository for Version Control and Team Collaboration

With GitOps, the infrastructure configuration is stored in a Git repository that serves as a single source of truth for the team. This provides version control, collaboration, and transparency to the team. Changes to the infrastructure are made via a pull request, which is reviewed by the team before being merged into the main branch. This ensures that everyone is aware of the changes being made and can provide feedback before the changes are implemented.

## GitOps in Practice

Implementing GitOps involves using a separate repository for infrastructure as code and building a DevOps pipeline to automate the process. Here's an overview of how GitOps is used in practice:

### Separate Repository for Infrastructure as Code Project

The first step in implementing GitOps is to create a separate repository for the infrastructure as code project. This repository will contain all the configuration files and scripts necessary to provision and manage the infrastructure.

### DevOps Pipeline for GitOps

To implement GitOps, a DevOps pipeline is built to automate the process of deploying changes to the infrastructure. This pipeline consists of several stages:

#### Pull Request Process for Changes

Changes to the infrastructure are made by creating a pull request in the Git repository. This pull request is reviewed by the team, and any necessary changes are made before the pull request is approved.

#### CI Pipeline for Validating and Testing Config Files

Once the pull request is approved, the changes are automatically validated and tested in a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This pipeline checks the configuration files for syntax errors, validates the changes against the infrastructure requirements, and runs automated tests to ensure that the changes don't break anything.

#### Approving and Merging Changes

After the changes have passed the CI pipeline, they are approved and merged into the main branch of the Git repository.

#### CD Pipeline for Automatic Deployment

Once the changes have been merged, they are automatically deployed to the infrastructure via a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. This pipeline ensures that the infrastructure is always up-to-date and that changes are deployed in a controlled and predictable manner.

### Push and Pull-Based Deployments

GitOps supports both push and pull-based deployments. In push-based deployments, changes are pushed to the infrastructure from the Git repository. In pull-based deployments, the infrastructure pulls changes from the Git repository. Each method has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the organization.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GitOps is a modern approach to infrastructure management that treats infrastructure as code. By using GitOps, teams can take advantage of all the benefits that come with treating infrastructure as code, such as version control, collaboration, and transparency. GitOps also provides automation and traceability to the infrastructure management process, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems. As infrastructure as code becomes more popular, we can expect GitOps to play an increasingly important role in the future of infrastructure management.
