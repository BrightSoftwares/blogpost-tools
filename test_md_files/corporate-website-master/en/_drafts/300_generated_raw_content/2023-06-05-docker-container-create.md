# Docker Container Create

## Introduction

Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It is a containerization technology that allows developers to package applications into isolated containers for easy deployment and management. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained, making them ideal for running applications in a distributed environment. In this article, we will discuss how to create a Docker container and the various options available for doing so.

## What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is a lightweight, isolated environment that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a single unit. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Docker containers are portable and can be run on any system that supports the Docker engine.

## Benefits of Docker Containers

Docker containers offer several benefits over traditional virtual machines. They are lightweight and portable, making them ideal for running applications in a distributed environment. They are also more secure than virtual machines, as they are isolated from each other and can be easily monitored and managed. Additionally, Docker containers are more efficient than virtual machines, as they can be quickly created and destroyed, and they can be easily scaled up or down as needed.

## How to Create a Docker Container

There are several ways to create a Docker container. The most common way is to use the Docker command-line interface (CLI). The Docker CLI provides a set of commands for creating, managing, and running Docker containers. Additionally, there are several third-party tools available for creating and managing Docker containers, such as OpenShift, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Kubectl, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, Podman, Google Cloud Platform, Prometheus, Grafana, Git, GitLab, Linux, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Jira, MongoDB, Apache Airflow, and Ubuntu.

## Docker CLI

The Docker CLI is the most common way to create a Docker container. It provides a set of commands for creating, managing, and running Docker containers. The most commonly used commands are `docker run`, `docker create`, and `docker start`.

The `docker run` command is used to create and run a Docker container. It takes a Docker image as an argument and creates a container from it. The `docker create` command is used to create a Docker container without running it. The `docker start` command is used to start a Docker container that has already been created.

## Third-Party Tools

There are several third-party tools available for creating and managing Docker containers. OpenShift, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Kubectl, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, Podman, Google Cloud Platform, Prometheus, Grafana, Git, GitLab, Linux, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Jira, MongoDB, Apache Airflow, and Ubuntu are some of the most popular tools for creating and managing Docker containers.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed how to create a Docker container and the various options available for doing so. We discussed the benefits of Docker containers and the most common way to create a Docker container, which is to use the Docker CLI. We also discussed several third-party tools available for creating and managing Docker containers.
