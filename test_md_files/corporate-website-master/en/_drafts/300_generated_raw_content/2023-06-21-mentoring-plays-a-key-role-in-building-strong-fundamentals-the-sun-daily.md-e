IN this week’s Success: The Insight Story column, Glocomp Systems (M) Sdn Bhd executive director Alex Liew (pic) answers SunBiz’s questions. My entrepreneurship journey started 25 years ago and it was not all smooth sailing. Working with more experienced team members is an example of leadership. When there are roadblocks, I always work together to solve problems as I believe that more minds are always better than one. For talent, there are three important areas that I look at – qualification, attitude and ambition. For those who are certified, it does not mean that they have the qualifications to do the job. A qualified person is someone who can do the right job with the right experience. Digital transformation is key to helping organisations to step up and be more competitive and efficient. Digital transformation and technology is an investment to grow the business to be more competitive; it is not an expense. Cloud adoption is increasing as it gets business applications and workloads running in a short time. Some successful examples of automation are in finance, accounting, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. What advice can you offer those looking to start their career/own business? It is extremely important to focus on your strengths to excel. However, in building a pathway to success, one key is leadership. How has mentorship made a difference in your professional life? Experiences shared by mentors helped forge a much shorter path to making improvements. I am blessed to have many mentors who assisted me in different stages of my career. Besides striving to greater heights in our core business, we are committed to building international-level skillsets with local talents. We look forward to working closely with the public and private sectors for key digital initiatives. Move away from our comfort zone to keep enriching anything that we do. When we feel comfortable and stay in our comfort zone, that is the start of trouble. When we think that we have no reason to improve, this is when we fail. He also brought a lot of new ideas to the team, and most importantly, he was able to lead the team to revolutionise innovation. Sincerity, which I feel gives comfort and commitment, is also key to building good human relations. 1, Hard work – Am a strong believer in that the harder you work, the luckier you will be.
