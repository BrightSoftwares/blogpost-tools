# Argo CD: A Kubernetes CD Pipeline Tool

Are you tired of manually deploying and managing your applications in Kubernetes? Do you want a tool that can automate the deployment process and provide a streamlined CD pipeline? Look no further than Argo CD.

Argo CD is a powerful tool designed specifically for Kubernetes. It allows you to deploy, manage, and automate your applications with ease, all through Kubernetes native YAML files. Argo CD is built with GitOps principles in mind, making it easy to use and integrate with your existing Git repositories.

## How Does Argo CD Work?

To configure Argo CD, you first need to deploy it in Kubernetes, just like any other tool. Argo CD extends the Kubernetes API with custom resource definitions (CRDs), allowing you to define the configuration of your applications with Kubernetes native YAML files.

The main component of Argo CD is the application. You can define an application CRD in a Kubernetes native YAML file. The main part of the configuration of an application is defining which Git repository should be synced with which Kubernetes cluster. This Git repository could be any Git repository in any Kubernetes cluster.

You can also configure multiple applications for different microservices, and group them in another CRD called app project.

## Is Argo CD a Replacement for Other CI/CD Tools Like Jenkins?

Argo CD is a replacement for a CD pipeline, specifically for Kubernetes. It is not a replacement for a CI pipeline, which is still necessary to configure pipelines to actually test and build application code changes.

Argo CD is also not the only GitOps CD tool for Kubernetes. Alternatives like Flux CD are already out there, and as the trend becomes more popular, more alternatives will likely be created.

## Seeing Argo CD in Action

To see Argo CD in action, we can use a simple but realistic demo. Let's assume that you have a Git repository with a simple web application that needs to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

You can configure Argo CD to sync with this Git repository and automatically deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster. Here's an example of what the YAML file for the application configuration might look like:



`apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata:   name: myapp spec:   destination:     namespace: default     server: https://kubernetes.default.svc   source:     repoURL: git@github.com:myuser/myapp.git     path: kubernetes     targetRevision: HEAD   project: default`

This YAML file defines an application called "myapp", which will be deployed to the "default" namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. The source of the application is a Git repository located at "[git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com):myuser/myapp.git", and it will sync with the "kubernetes" directory of the repository at the "HEAD" revision.

With this YAML file configured, Argo CD will automatically deploy any changes made to the "kubernetes" directory of the Git repository to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Conclusion

Argo CD is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for managing and automating your applications in Kubernetes. With GitOps principles in mind, it streamlines the deployment process and provides a straightforward CD pipeline. While it is not a replacement for a CI pipeline or the only GitOps CD tool for Kubernetes, it is a popular and reliable option. Give it a try and see how it can simplify your deployment process.
