Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes, used to simplify the deployment and management of applications in a Kubernetes cluster. In this blog post, we will go through the main concepts of Helm, its use cases, and how to use it in your own projects.

## What is Helm?

Helm is a tool that streamlines the installation and management of Kubernetes applications. It provides a simple way to package, deploy, and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster using pre-configured templates called Helm Charts.

### Helm Charts

Helm Charts are packages that contain all the necessary files to deploy a Kubernetes application, including configuration files, templates, and manifests. Helm Charts are written in YAML format and can be easily customized to suit your needs. They provide a modular way to manage your application and can be easily shared with others.

## Understanding Helm Architecture

To fully understand Helm, it is important to understand its architecture. Helm consists of two main components: the Helm client and Tiller.

### Helm Client

The Helm client is a command-line tool used to interact with Helm Charts. It can be used to search, install, update, and delete Helm Charts. The Helm client is installed on your local machine or development environment.

### Tiller

Tiller is the server-side component of Helm. It runs within the Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for managing Helm releases. Tiller manages the installation, upgrade, and deletion of Helm Charts on the cluster.

## How to use Helm

Using Helm is straightforward. To use Helm, you need to have the Helm client installed on your local machine or development environment. Once you have Helm installed, you can use it to search for Helm Charts, install them, and manage your applications.

### Installing Helm

To install Helm on your machine, you can follow the installation instructions from the Helm documentation. Here is an example of installing Helm on macOS using Homebrew:



```bash
brew install helm
```

### Searching for Helm Charts

To search for Helm Charts, you can use the `search` command:



```bash
helm search <keyword>
```

### Installing Helm Charts

To install a Helm Chart, you can use the `install` command:



```bash
helm install <chart-name> <chart-repository>
```

### Updating Helm Charts

To update a Helm Chart, you can use the `upgrade` command:



```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-name>
```

### Deleting Helm Charts

To delete a Helm Chart, you can use the `delete` command:


```bash
helm delete <release-name>
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we went through the main concepts of Helm, its use cases, and how to use it in your own projects. We also looked at Helm Charts and how they provide a modular way to manage your application. By understanding the basic principles of Helm and its architecture, you can easily use it to deploy and manage your applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
