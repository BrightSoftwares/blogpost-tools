How to query between two dates using Laravel and Eloquent?

# How to Query Between Two Dates Using Laravel and Eloquent?

Are you tired of manually sorting through your database to find entries between two specific dates? Look no further! With Laravel and Eloquent, you can easily query between two dates with just a few simple steps. In this article, we’ll explore the process of querying between two dates using Laravel and Eloquent.

## Introduction to Laravel and Eloquent

Before we dive into querying between two dates, let’s first take a quick look at Laravel and Eloquent. Laravel is a PHP framework used for web development. It provides a variety of tools and features to make web development faster and easier. Eloquent, on the other hand, is Laravel’s ORM (Object Relational Mapping) system, which allows developers to interact with databases using PHP code.

## Setting up the Database

To query between two dates, we need to first set up our database with some data. For the purpose of this tutorial, let’s assume we have a table called `orders` that has the following columns:

-   `id`
-   `customer_name`
-   `order_date`

To set up the database, we’ll need to create a migration file by running the following command in our terminal:



`php artisan make:migration create_orders_table --create=orders`

Once the migration file is created, we can add the columns to our `orders` table in the `up` function:



`public function up() {     Schema::create('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {         $table->id();         $table->string('customer_name');         $table->date('order_date');         $table->timestamps();     }); }`

After adding the columns, we can run the migration to create the `orders` table:



`php artisan migrate`

Now that we have our `orders` table set up, let’s insert some sample data to work with:



`DB::table('orders')->insert([     [         'customer_name' => 'John Doe',         'order_date' => '2022-01-01',     ],     [         'customer_name' => 'Jane Doe',         'order_date' => '2022-02-15',     ],     [         'customer_name' => 'Bob Smith',         'order_date' => '2022-03-30',     ], ]);`

## Querying Between Two Dates

With our database set up and some sample data inserted, we can now start querying between two dates. Let’s say we want to find all orders that were made between January 1, 2022, and March 1, 2022. We can do this using the `whereBetween` method in Eloquent:



`$orders = DB::table('orders')     ->whereBetween('order_date', ['2022-01-01', '2022-03-01'])     ->get();`

In the above code, we’re using the `whereBetween` method to find all orders where the `order_date` column is between January 1, 2022, and March 1, 2022. The `get` method retrieves all matching records from the database.

## Querying Between Two Dates with Carbon

We can also use the Carbon library in Laravel to make querying between two dates even easier. Carbon is a PHP library that extends the `DateTime` class and provides additional functionality for working with dates and times.

To use Carbon, we first need to install it using Composer:



`composer require nesbot/carbon`

After installing Carbon, we can use it to create date objects:



`use Carbon\Carbon;  $date = Carbon::parse('2022-`

Now that we have Carbon installed and a date object created, we can use it to query between two dates. Let’s say we want to find all orders that were made between January 1, 2022, and March 1, 2022, but this time using Carbon to create the date objects:



`use Carbon\Carbon;  $startDate = Carbon::parse('2022-01-01'); $endDate = Carbon::parse('2022-03-01');  $orders = DB::table('orders')     ->whereBetween('order_date', [$startDate, $endDate])     ->get();`

By using Carbon to create the date objects, we can pass them directly to the `whereBetween` method, making our code more readable and easier to maintain.

## Conclusion

In this article, we’ve explored how to query between two dates using Laravel and Eloquent. We first set up our database with some sample data and then used the `whereBetween` method to find all orders that were made between two specific dates. We also learned how to use the Carbon library to make creating date objects and querying between two dates even easier.

By using Laravel and Eloquent, we can easily manipulate our data and get the results we need. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just getting started with Laravel, this technique will save you time and effort in querying your database.
