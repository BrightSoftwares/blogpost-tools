If you are a developer, you might be familiar with Laravel - the popular PHP framework. Laravel Eloquent is one of the essential components of Laravel that makes working with databases more manageable and enjoyable. In this article, we'll explore what Laravel Eloquent is, how it works, and how you can use it to create powerful and efficient database queries.

## What is Laravel Eloquent?

Laravel Eloquent is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies working with databases in Laravel. It provides an easy-to-use and intuitive interface for working with databases by mapping database tables to models in Laravel. With Eloquent, you can interact with the database using a set of methods and properties, rather than writing raw SQL queries.

## Understanding Eloquent Models

In Laravel, an Eloquent model represents a table in your database. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the table by defining relationships between tables, creating constraints, and performing other tasks.

### Defining Eloquent Models

To define an Eloquent model in Laravel, you need to create a new PHP class that extends the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` class. You also need to define the table name that the model represents.



`namespace App\Models;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class User extends Model {     protected $table = 'users'; }`

In the example above, we define an Eloquent model for the `users` table in our database.

### Retrieving Records

Once you have defined an Eloquent model, you can use it to retrieve records from the database. You can use various methods to retrieve records, such as `all`, `find`, `where`, `orderBy`, `limit`, and `offset`.



`// Retrieve all users $users = App\Models\User::all();  // Find a user by ID $user = App\Models\User::find(1);  // Find all users where the email is 'example@example.com' $users = App\Models\User::where('email', 'example@example.com')->get();  // Find all users ordered by name $users = App\Models\User::orderBy('name')->get();  // Find the first five users $users = App\Models\User::limit(5)->get();  // Find all users except the first five $users = App\Models\User::offset(5)->get();`

### Creating Records

You can also use Eloquent models to create new records in the database. To create a new record, you can create a new instance of the Eloquent model and set the attributes.



`$user = new App\Models\User; $user->name = 'John Doe'; $user->email = 'john@example.com'; $user->password = bcrypt('password'); $user->save();`

### Updating Records

To update an existing record in the database, you can retrieve the record, update the attributes, and save the changes.



`$user = App\Models\User::find(1); $user->name = 'Jane Doe'; $user->save();`

### Deleting Records

To delete a record from the database, you can retrieve the record and call the `delete` method.



`$user = App\Models\User::find(1); $user->delete();`

## Defining Relationships between Models

Eloquent allows you to define relationships between models in Laravel, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

### One-to-One Relationship

In a one-to-one relationship, each record in the first table has one related record in the second table.



`class User extends Model {     public function phone()     {         return $this->hasOne(Phone::class);`

## Defining Relationships between Models (Continued)

### One-to-One Relationship

In a one-to-one relationship, each record in the first table has one related record in the second table.



`class User extends Model {     public function phone()     {         return $this->hasOne(Phone::class);     } }  class Phone extends Model {     public function user()     {         return $this->belongsTo(User::class);     } }`

In the example above, we define a one-to-one relationship between the `User` and `Phone` models. Each user has one phone, and each phone belongs to one user.

### One-to-Many Relationship

In a one-to-many relationship, each record in the first table can have multiple related records in the second table.



`class User extends Model {     public function posts()     {         return $this->hasMany(Post::class);     } }  class Post extends Model {     public function user()     {         return $this->belongsTo(User::class);     } }`

In the example above, we define a one-to-many relationship between the `User` and `Post` models. Each user can have multiple posts, and each post belongs to one user.

### Many-to-Many Relationship

In a many-to-many relationship, each record in the first table can have multiple related records in the second table, and vice versa.



`class User extends Model {     public function roles()     {         return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class);     } }  class Role extends Model {     public function users()     {         return $this->belongsToMany(User::class);     } }`

In the example above, we define a many-to-many relationship between the `User` and `Role` models. Each user can have multiple roles, and each role can be assigned to multiple users.

## Eager Loading Relationships

Eager loading is a technique that allows you to retrieve related records from the database along with the primary record, reducing the number of queries required to retrieve data.



`$users = App\Models\User::with('posts')->get();`

In the example above, we use the `with` method to eager load the `posts` relationship for all users.

## Conclusion

Laravel Eloquent is a powerful and efficient tool for working with databases in Laravel. With Eloquent, you can interact with the database using a set of intuitive methods and properties, making database queries more manageable and enjoyable. By defining relationships between models and using eager loading, you can retrieve related data from the database with ease, reducing the number of queries required to retrieve data.
