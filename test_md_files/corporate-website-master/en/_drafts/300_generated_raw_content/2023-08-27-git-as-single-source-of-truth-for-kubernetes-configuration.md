# Git as Single Source of Truth for Kubernetes Configuration

As Kubernetes becomes the standard for container orchestration, managing configurations for a cluster can become challenging. With multiple team members making changes to the cluster, it becomes difficult to maintain consistency and avoid conflicting changes. That's where Git comes in. By using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes configuration, teams can ensure that everyone is working on the same page and avoid conflicts.

## Benefits of Using Git for Kubernetes Configuration

The primary benefit of using Git for Kubernetes configuration is that it provides a single interface for making changes to the cluster. Instead of having team members make changes from their laptops and executing scripts or using `kubectl apply` or `helm install` commands, everyone can use the same interface. This makes it easier to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.

Another benefit is that using Git as a single source of truth gives teams a way to collaborate on any changes in the cluster. Members can propose a change in Kubernetes, which others can discuss and work on. When done, the changes can be merged into the main branch.

Additionally, using Git provides a history of changes as well as an audit trail of who changed what in the cluster. This makes it easier to track changes and identify any issues that arise.

## Argo CD for Managing Kubernetes Configuration with Git

Argo CD is an open-source tool that automates the deployment of Kubernetes applications from Git repositories. It not only watches the changes in the Git repository but also watches the changes in the cluster. Whenever a change happens in either the Git repository or the cluster, Argo CD compares those two states. If it sees that something has changed in either of the two places and they don't match anymore, it knows that it has to do something. That something is always to sync whatever is defined in the Git repository to the cluster.

For example, if someone goes and makes manual changes in the cluster, Argo CD will detect that and it will see that the states have diverged. The cluster state is different than the Git repository state, so it will sync the changes and overwrite whatever was done manually. This guarantees that the Git repository and whatever is defined there remains the only source of truth for your cluster state. It also gives you full transparency of the cluster because you know that whatever is defined in that Git repository as a configuration code is exactly the state you have in the cluster.

## Using Git and Argo CD Together

Using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes configuration and Argo CD for managing the deployment of Kubernetes applications from Git repositories is a powerful combination. With this approach, teams can ensure that all changes are tracked and recorded in a version-controlled way. This provides a history of changes and an audit trail of who changed what in the cluster.

One interesting use case arises when someone in the team decides to quickly update something in a cluster. It's much quicker to just do a `kubectl apply` than to write the code changes, commit them, push them, get a review from colleagues, and then eventually merge them into the repository. However, if someone does make manual changes in the cluster, you can configure Argo CD to not automatically override and undo those manual cluster changes. Instead, it can send out an alert that something has changed in the cluster manually and that it needs to be updated in the code as well.

## Conclusion

Using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes configuration provides teams with a standardized way to make changes to the cluster. This ensures consistency and avoids conflicts. Argo CD takes this approach one step further by automating the deployment of Kubernetes applications from Git repositories. It provides a history of changes and an audit trail of who changed what in the cluster. By using Git and Argo CD together, teams can collaborate on changes in the

is that it allows for version control, which is essential when multiple developers are working on the same codebase. Git allows developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate on code in a controlled and organized way.

Another significant benefit of using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes configurations is that it ensures consistency across environments. With Git, you can create different branches for different environments, such as development, testing, and production, and deploy changes to each environment in a controlled manner. This ensures that all environments are in sync and reduces the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies.

Now, let's take a closer look at how Git can be used to manage Kubernetes configurations. First, all configurations are defined as code and stored in a Git repository. This means that instead of executing scripts or running kubectl commands from their laptops, developers use the same interface to make changes in the cluster. This ensures consistency and eliminates the possibility of different developers making conflicting changes.

When a change is made to the Git repository, Argo CD automatically detects the change and compares the desired state defined in the Git repository to the actual state in the cluster. If the two states do not match, Argo CD automatically syncs the changes to the cluster, ensuring that the Git repository remains the single source of truth for the cluster state.

But what happens when someone manually updates the cluster, either by mistake or because they need to make a quick change? In this case, Argo CD detects the manual change and sends an alert, giving developers the option to either override the manual change and sync the Git repository to the cluster or leave the manual change in place and update the Git repository accordingly.

Using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes configurations offers many benefits, including consistency across environments, version control, and collaboration. By storing all configurations as code in a Git repository, developers can ensure that changes are tracked, audited, and documented, reducing the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies. And by using Argo CD to automatically sync changes between the Git repository and the cluster, developers can ensure that the Git repository remains the single source of truth for the cluster state at all times.
