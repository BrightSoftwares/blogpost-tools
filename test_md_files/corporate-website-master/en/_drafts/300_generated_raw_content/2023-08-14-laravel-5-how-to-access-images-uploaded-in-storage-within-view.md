## Introduction to Laravel 5

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of accessing images uploaded in storage within view, let's first understand what Laravel 5 is. Laravel is an open-source PHP web application framework that is designed to make web development easier and more efficient. It's built with elegance, simplicity, and readability in mind, making it the go-to choice for developers who want to create web applications quickly.

## Uploading Images in Storage

Now that we've covered what Laravel 5 is, let's move on to how you can upload images in storage. To upload an image in Laravel 5, you need to use the `store` method provided by the `Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile` class. The `store` method will store the uploaded file in a disk storage location, which you can specify in your configuration files.

## Accessing Images in Storage within View

So, now that we've uploaded our images in storage, how do we access them within view? The answer is simple. We use the `asset` function provided by Laravel. The `asset` function generates a URL for an asset using the current scheme of the request, which allows you to access your images within view.

To access your images within view, you need to follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Get the Image Path

To get the image path, you can use the `Storage::url()` method. This method returns the URL for a given file stored in your storage.



`$imagePath = Storage::url('path/to/image.jpg');`

### Step 2: Use the Asset Function

Once you have the image path, you can use the `asset` function to generate a URL for the image.



`<img src="{{ asset($imagePath) }}" alt="My Image">`

That's it! You can now access your images uploaded in storage within view with ease.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, accessing images uploaded in storage within view in Laravel 5 is easy, thanks to the `asset` function provided by Laravel. By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you'll be able to impress your clients with your proficiency in Laravel and make their web applications look even better.
