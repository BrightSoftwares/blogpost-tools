Get the Last Inserted Id Using Laravel Eloquent

# Get the Last Inserted Id Using Laravel Eloquent

Are you tired of manually tracking the last inserted ID in your Laravel application? Have you been searching for an easier way to retrieve the latest inserted ID using Laravel Eloquent? Look no further! In this article, we will explore the step-by-step process of getting the last inserted ID using Laravel Eloquent.

## Introduction to Laravel Eloquent

Before we dive into retrieving the last inserted ID using Laravel Eloquent, let's first understand what Laravel Eloquent is. Laravel Eloquent is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that provides an easy-to-use interface for communicating with your database. Eloquent is designed to work with a variety of databases, including MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL. Eloquent simplifies database operations by allowing developers to work with PHP objects instead of SQL statements.

## What is Last Inserted ID?

The last inserted ID is the ID of the last record inserted into the database table. Retrieving the last inserted ID is crucial in scenarios where we need to reference a newly inserted record in another table.

## Retrieving the Last Inserted ID

Now let's dive into the process of retrieving the last inserted ID using Laravel Eloquent. We will use the save method in Laravel Eloquent to insert a new record into the database and retrieve the last inserted ID.

### Step 1: Create a Model

First, we need to create a model for the database table we want to insert data into. In this example, we will create a model for the "users" table using the following command:

`php artisan make:model User`

This command will create a new model file in the app/Models directory.

### Step 2: Insert Data into the Database

Next, we will use the save method to insert data into the database table. We can do this by creating a new instance of the model and setting its attributes. For example, to insert a new user into the database, we can use the following code:



`$user = new User; $user->name = 'John Doe'; $user->email = 'johndoe@example.com'; $user->save();`

This code will insert a new record into the "users" table.

### Step 3: Retrieve the Last Inserted ID

To retrieve the last inserted ID using Laravel Eloquent, we can use the `$user->id` property after saving the new record. For example, after saving the new user, we can retrieve the last inserted ID using the following code:



`$lastInsertedId = $user->id;`

This code will retrieve the last inserted ID for the new user record.

With Laravel Eloquent, you can easily communicate with your database using PHP objects instead of SQL statements.
