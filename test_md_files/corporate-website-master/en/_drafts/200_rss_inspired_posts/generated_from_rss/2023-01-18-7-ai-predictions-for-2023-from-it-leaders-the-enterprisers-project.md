title: 7 AI predictions for 2023 from IT leaders | The Enterprisers Project
---

December is here, so you know what that means: holiday parties, new year’s resolutions, and a slew of technology predictions. We decided to focus on a trend that matters most urgently to IT leaders—concrete artificial intelligence (AI) insights for your team and business. Language I/O CTO Diego Bartolome says that “machine learning will help correct AI bias. After all, providers want their physicians focused on healthcare delivery, not technology. CTOs should not buy AI because it’s AI or because it’s the latest and greatest tech. Organizations want to see results and need to be able to measure impact. A CTO can’t just make a big statement that AI is the future and get whatever budget they want. —Michael Armstrong, Chief Technology Officer, Authenticx

Groundbreaking impacts of AI technology

“AI will yield tremendous breakthroughs in treating medical conditions in the next few years. Just look at the 2021 Breakthrough Prize winner Dr. David Baker. While I’m not holding my breath for a practical quantum computer, we will see crossover. Humans applying the insights provided by AI will be a more effective combination overall than either one doing it alone. How and where this balance is struck will vary depending on the industry and the criticality of the function being performed. For example, radiologists assisted by an AI screen for breast cancer more successfully than they do when they work alone, according to new research. —E.G. Nadhan, Global Chief Architect Leader, Red Hat

Responsible and generative AI capabilities are improving

"We can expect to see a few major AI trends in 2023, and two to watch are responsible AI and generative AI. Smarter technology and emerging legal frameworks around AI are also steps in the right direction. Similar to GDPR for data usage, The AI Act could become a baseline standard for responsible AI and aims to become law next Spring. Recent models can easily create realistic images and drawings from a description in natural language. Capabilities like this are now moving from cool functionality to actual business use cases. Instead of searching through stock photography, you can type a query and get a newly generated image. Another trend we’re already seeing is the continued push to embrace AI holistically across the organization. Various software and hardware solutions—from data models to AI chips—are focused on taking a slice of the lucrative AI pie.” AI already completes many tasks that would take humans thousands of hours to accomplish: beat chess grandmasters, identify fractures in X-rays, choose the fastest route for a delivery truck, etc. It can’t explain why one chess move is more strategic than another the way a human could – it just knows. But AI solves a massive array of tasks in and outside of the workplace. Get the eBook: Top considerations for building a production-ready AI/ML environment. ]
