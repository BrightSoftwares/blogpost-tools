Noscoteks decade of experience in the local as well as international market resulted in a strong technical team. The company prides itself on providing cutting edge software for document management, business process management, and optimisation. On the other hand, Automate now complements this offering with its decades of expertise in automating processes and digitising documents.

Werner Engelbrecht, a director at Automate Now, joined Kyocera 16.5 years ago and left at the end of June this year. He was Cfo for four of these years and for another four years was Ceo of the organisation.

He decided to start his own business Automate Now to help other companies with digital transformation. journey.

We embarked on this strategic alliance with Noscotek to collaborate on sourcing the best available technology to bring to market and help organisations digitally transform. While most companies wish to start this journey, most don't know where to start. And it gives us an opportunity to offer them the technology and skills they need to help them on their digital transformation journey.

There are many manual processes in most organisations which have little or no integration into these systems. And that is where our partnership is able to guide people in digitising their manual processes into a workflow.

Once this has been implemented, it allows you to start monitoring the performance of these processes and to see where the bottlenecks are in the organisation. It's hard to determine inefficiencies or bottlenecks in manual processes.

Another key observation by Engelbrecht is that human beings are very much creatures of habit when it comes to how they perform tasks or processes. When asked why they do a task in a particular way, they often say its always done as such. This gives us the opportunity to come into a discussion of the current processes of the people who are involved.

He believes the customer always knows his business better than anyone else and that the knowledge they are able to share is the key to enable Automate Now to look at existing processes and see how they can be improved by using technology or even a.

Recent developments around software for process mining enables a platform for new innovation. The data from the primary systems of a business a software resembling a Crm or an Erp provides complete visibility into processes.

We were very excited about this alliance, bringing together our extensive software offering and automate Nows experience to offer digital transformation solutions that are specific to each customer journey.
