title: Logistics companies thinking beyond the box of automation
---

Logistics service providers are taking a new radical approach to win business by using flexible automation with margins under pressure and labor in short supply. **



The traditional 3plclient relationship is changing a lot about automation. Whereas a 3pl would normally win a contract first and possibly install automation if it was thought appropriate for efficient and profitable execution. Now, some 3pls are looking to invest in automation first and then pitch their.


A typical contract with a client is for around two or three years, and now clients tend to seek shorter rather than longer commitments. The risk has always been that if automation is tailored to the needs of a specific client and that client does not renew, the 3pl may not achieve as fast as expected. an roi.


Flexible Automation is now altering the dynamics of the warehouse and this is reshaping how 3pls present their services to customers. Automated fit-to-size packaging systems not only offer high volume throughput, low labour content, improved material use, and better transport efficiency demand 3pls and their clients, but critically, they also provide the essential flexibility that will future-proof the investment.


The ability to scan and shape package size at speeds of up to 1100 packages per hour is simply being put by advanced right-sized packaging systems such as Sparck Technologies, Cvp, Everest, and Impack Machines. Typically replacing up to 20 manual packing stations. Work which can be redeployed to more rewarding and useful tasks. If you have the lucky chance.


Both solutions can have up to three card mills feeding for example, continuous fanfold cards of different sizes 60cm, 80cm, 100cm which ensures optimal use of card on the fly, reducing waste and minimising costs. The three card mills could hold individual branded card feeds, which would allow multiple brands of clients to be packed by a single machine.


Sparck Technologies has analysed 10 million packages in various sectors over the last couple of years, so we can reasonably claim that our figures are robust. On average box volumes are reduced by up to 50% or more (83% has been recorded) with benefits in more efficient use of costly transport and greater consumer satisfaction  – not least through the elimination of void fill.


What about flexibility and cost saving? These packaging systems are flexible in many ways. They can first pack orders for several clients in random order identified by bar codes. This can be achieved either with preprinted fanfold labelled card feeds, or we can also offer in-line mono or Cymk printing of neutral cards on three sides.


But we can also provide flexibility in another sense. Sparck Technologies can acquire packaging systems on lease rather than outright purchase. 3pls can minimise risk from a downturn or lease more happily if business is booming. This low-risk approach is adopted by a growing number of leading 3pls in the Netherlands and the Uk, such as Global Freight Management, Ceva Logistics Van Eupen, and Gvil.


Creative thinking around Automation is actively helping 3pls win new business and plays an essential role in delivering enhanced value to existing clients, helping service providers retain customers, protect margin, and extend client contracts.
