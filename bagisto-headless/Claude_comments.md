💪 I Can Help You:
Option 1: Generate your first custom payment gateway plugin right now

Tell me which payment processor (Stripe, Paystack, Flutterwave, etc.)
I'll write production-ready code in 5-30 minutes
You review, test, deploy

Option 2: Answer specific technical questions

Jekyll integration patterns
Security configuration details
Custom plugin architecture
Deployment troubleshooting

Option 3: Create detailed implementation guides

Specific to your payment processor
Your shipping requirements
Your marketing automation needs


🎓 THE HONEST TRUTH:
Based on everything you've shared:

✅ Limited time (1 hour/evening)
✅ Tight budget (free-tier first)
✅ Existing o2switch hosting
✅ 127 unfinished projects
✅ Goal: Ship products, reach €10K MRR
✅ Product-first philosophy

Bagisto is THE RIGHT CHOICE for your situation.
Medusa is architecturally superior for enterprise scale, but requires:

New hosting costs (€240-600/year)
Complex DevOps (VPS, PostgreSQL, Redis, worker processes)
Longer deployment time (7+ weeks vs 4 weeks)

You don't need "better architecture" - you need REVENUE.
Bagisto gets you selling in 4 weeks.
Medusa gets you better architecture in 7+ weeks.
Your enemy isn't inadequate technology - it's the 127 unfinished projects.

⏰ Time to Decide:
Every day spent evaluating = lost revenue opportunity.
My recommendation: Install Bagisto TODAY (30 minutes), ship your first store in 4 weeks, reach €2K MRR, then evaluate if you need Medusa's advanced features.
What do you want to do first?

Install Bagisto and I'll guide you through setup?
Generate a custom payment gateway plugin for your specific processor?
Deep-dive into a specific technical area?
Create your deployment automation (GitHub Actions for o2switch)?
